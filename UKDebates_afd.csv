0,Five years ago this country was on the brink we had millions of people unemployed and we had one of the biggest budget deficits anywhere in the world,0
1,for the last 5 years we've been working with the British people through a long-term economic plan and that plan is working,1
2,there are almost 2 million more people in work,0
3,it's a balance plan so we've invested in our NHS as well as reducing the deficit and we cut taxes for 30 million working people,1
4,and the plan's working because last year we had the fastest growing economy of any of the major Western countries,1
5,now tonight you're going to hear a lot of people claiming a lot of things,0
6,but please remember these are the same people who claimed that if we followed our plan unemployment would go up and that the deficit wouldn't come down the economy wouldn't grow the public services would be destroyed,0
7,they were wrong then and they are wrong now,1
8,"the choice of this election is sticking with a plan that's working, or going back to the debt, taxes, borrowing and spending that got us in this mess in the first place",1
9,I say let's not go back to square one Britain can do so much better than that,1
10,well first of all what I'd say is that we've got a plan which is working: we've taken 3 million of the lowest paid people out of tax and we got almost 2 million people back into work,1
11,but I think what is absolutely crucial here is recognizing that what our plan involves is balance,1
12,we're gonna go on investing in the NHS every year as we have done under this government under the last Parliament,0
13,we're going to do that in the next parliament,0
14,we're going to find savings of one out of every pounds 100 that the government spends,0
15,and we need to do that for two more years just as we've done for the last 5 years,1
16,but the alternative to that plan is actually putting up taxes and I don't want to do that,1
17,"I think that if we go back to the tax, the waste, the spending and the debt, all the things that got us into a mess in the first place, we wouldn't help working people we'd hurt working people, that's what Labour did last time, we mustn't let it happen again",1
18,"Nick is wrong about our plans, because of course we are going to raise 5 billion from tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance as we've done in this Parliament",1
19,now that's part of the balance plan that also involves putting more money into our NHS,0
20,here's the point: we've got to understand why the deficit matters and why we got here,0
21,"and the problem with the real choice is with Ed Miliband, who still thinks the last Labour government didn't tax too much, borrow too much, and spend too much and if you don't understand the mistakes of the past, you can't provide the leadership for the future",1
22,once again he's wrong: just this week we've introduced a diverted-profits tax to go off to these companies that make money in Britain and don't pay tax in Britain,1
23,"but here's what Ed Miliband isn't telling you because he doesn't support any of the spending reductions and efficiencies we've had to make. He wants to make a very big cut. He wants to put up taxes and cut your pay going into your monthly payslip at the end of the month and taking your money out, because he thinks he can spend that money better than you",0
24,"we have cut the deficit in half, we need to clear the rest of it and we'll do that in the coming years, but only if we stick to the plan, and the plan that is working; but it is worth remembering as we debate cuts why did these cuts have to happen, what is the truth about cuts?",1
25,well I've got the truth about cuts here: this is a copy of the letter that Labour left in the Treasury when we arrived in government 5 years ago and it says I'm sorry we've run out of money,0
26,"that is the truth of what happens when people talk about cuts. We had to make these decisions because the British economy was on the brink, people were worrying about whether we'll be able to pay our debts",0
27,"the brunt of these cuts and the changes we've made, the top 20% have paid more than the remaining 80% put together, that's what happened when Labour were in power and my fear is if they got in power",0
28,"we are going to build 200000 houses for people to buy, we're going to keep on with this reduction in unemployment that sees two million more people in work",0
29,but you won't do it if we go back to the debt the welfare the spending and the taxes,1
30,"what I would say to Johnny is: we're gonna find pounds 1 out of every 100 that the government spends and save that in each of the next 2 year combined with the extra taxes in terms of tax avoidance and tax evasion, we will eliminate the deficit",0
31,it's also put more burden on some of the richest people through instance through having a stamp duty on expensive properties,0
32,"but what I'm hearing in this debate is that, whereas I want to save one out of every pounds 100 the government spends to not put up taxes,what I'm hearing is: more debt and more taxes, more debt and more taxes, a lot more debt and more taxes",0
33,"in the last Parliament, Nicholas, we found pounds 21bn of savings in welfare",0
34,now what is the alternative to making reductions on welfare? it is putting up taxes,1
35,"well first of all thank you Terry for your incredible service to the NHS, and you're absolutely right, this is the most important national institution and national public service that we have",1
36,I'll never forget as a dad of a desperately disabled child what I got every night when I took him to hospital worrying about his health,0
37,I got unbelievable care and I just want that for every family and for everyone in our country,1
38,now we've been talking about the difficult decisions we had to make to turn the economy around,0
39,"but a difficult decision we made also was to go on funding the NHS, putting more money in every year and we'll go on doing that in the next parliament",0
40,"we've have trained 7000 more nurses, we've got 9000 more doctors, and we also managed to take out of the NHS 20000 bureaucrats because I want the money spent on patient care",1
41,now it's key that we keep a strong economy in order to fund a strong NHS,1
42,and I want to see the NHS move to much more seven-day operation like your GP being open 8 in the morning 8 in the evening all the way through the week,1
43,there is one point I want to end on: there is only one group of politicians anywhere in this United Kingdom that cut the NHS in the last 5 years and that was the Labour Party in Wales,0
44,so when you hear Ed Miliband's promises think about that,0
45,what we have seen with cancer under this government is 460000 more people a year getting seen and getting examined for cancer than used to happen,0
46,our survival rate for cancer that used to be some of the worse in Europe now actually is one of the best in Europe we are changing the NHS and we are improving it,1
47,but a strong NHS needs a strong economy,1
48,"if we go back to Labour's plans for taxes and debt and spending and welfare the economy will be wrecked, and that will wreck the NHS",1
49,"The commitment we made is important, because when I said we'd fund the NHS more every year the Labour view was that was irresponsible",1
50,the Liberal Democrat view was that wasn't the right approach and Labour cut the NHS in Wales where the outcomes are worst,0
51,let me tell Ed Miliband what we did: we took 20000 bureaucrats out of the NHS and put 9000 doctors and 7000 nurses in,0
52,"and he opposes those reforms, presumably he'd like to rehire the bureaucrats. I want doctors with stethoscopes not bureaucrats with clipboards",1
53,but let me answer Terry very directly about the things we can really do to make a difference with our NHS,0
54,dementia is a silent crisis in our country we are raising the diagnosing rates we need to keep going with that,1
55,this point about a seven-day operation is really important. just a few miles down the road from where we are tonight is the Salford Royal Hospital,0
56,they carry out operations and scans and treatments on Saturday and Sunday as much as they do Monday to Friday and as a result they provide a fantastic service,1
57,so we can improve our NHS if we improve the way it works and go off to the things like dementia like Public Health and some of the big Public Health challenges that put so much pressure onto our NHS,1
58,"Ed Miliband is scaremongering and he said in an interview that he wanted to weaponize the NHS, now for most of us the NHS is a service for our families, not a political weapon",1
59,"and I think let's be clear about Social Care. We are starting, starting on the 1st of April, a new fund, the Better Care Fund, with pounds 5.3bn in, bringing Health and Social Care together",0
60,so we can unblock those hospital beds make sure the people get the care they need in the community,0
61,but Nick was talking about inheritance we had,0
62,"there was something else we inherited in the NHS which was a culture, too often from Labour, of cover up",0
63,"just 60 miles from where we are is the Mid Stafford Hospital, and we all remember what we uncovered with that public enquiry that elderly people were being left uncared for, some of them drinking out of water vials because where weren't looked after, because the target culture had run rampant",0
64,"we have changed that and we've made sure there are more nurses on ward, more doctors in charge, and standards of care going up in our NHS",0
65,there are more nurses more doctors more people being treated and that's because we have a strong economy,1
66,he talks about failure let's remember the failure of the last Labour government that virtually bankrupted this country and left us with impossibly difficult decision,0
67,but the biggest decision we made was to protect the NHS and to spend more every year: a decision that Labour at the time said was irresponsible,0
68,"that's what they said, we ignored that and we went ahead and invested in our NHS as part of a balance plan for our country",0
69,there's the point about the 5.3bn fund that will help fund those vital social care that Nathan is talking about,0
70,"but I also want to say how important I think it is that we have a seven-day NHS with your GP being open 8 in the morning 8 in the evening 7 days a week because the areas of the country where that's already happening, some of them here in Greater Manchester, were seeing a lot less pressure on hospitals cause people can get to see their GPs when they want",1
71,all of this is taking the extra resources that we put into the NHS because the long-term economic plan is working,1
72,"oh we do have benefits from immigration as I said in my opening statement but I think the choice really boils down to this Nigel is saying there's nothing you can do inside the European Union so just give up and leave Ed seems to be saying he doesn't want to renegotiate anything in Europe so should just give up altogether I say get stuck in, renegotiate get the changes we need and then put those in a referendum to the British people by the end of 2017",1
73,I've sat around that table in Europe and negotiated for Britain you can get things done and I've said I want to get done so that we can sort out this immigration issue,1
74,"people said it was impossible, we cut that European budget",0
75,"I said let's get out of these bailout funds where British taxpayers money was being put into countries like Greece, people said you'll never do that, we got out of those Greek bailout funds",0
76,so instead giving up let's get stuck in and negotiate,0
77,the problem with Nigel in the end is ultimately Nigel you are just the back door to a Labor government which will give us open-door immigration which is not what this country,0
78,"if we want to control immigration there are three sides to this coin you've got to have an education system that turns out young people that can do the jobs that our economy is creating you have got to have a welfare system that makes sure that work always pays, and we really helped to delivered that over the last few years and you've got to have the immigration changes that I've been talking about",1
79,"it's not simply about what happens in Europe if I think of what we inherited we had bogus colleges that were handing out visas like visa factories, we've shut them down",0
80,we had people who could claim benefits literally on arrival when Ed Miliband was in the cabinet we've stopped that,0
81,"we had people appealing in our courts against decisions made here, we've now said you have to go home and appeal from home, there are changes you can make",0
82,"we created 2 million jobs because we got a strong and growing economy, when he was sat in the cabinet about half a million people lost their jobs and never mind zero hours, with Ed there'd be zero jobs",1
83,"let me take on Nigel on this, look Nigel, you want to leave the EU it's a very clear position",0
84,"but the only way that can happen is by having a referendum; now I say stay in, fight, get a better deal but hold that referendum",1
85,the irony of Nigel's position is if people vote for him they end up with Miliband and they get no referendum no renegotiation,1
86,we have taken some people from Syria some of the most vulnerable people including elderly and disabled people,0
87,"but the most important thing we can do in Syria is maintain the fact that we are one of the biggest, I think the second largest bilateral aid donor, helping people in those refugee camps to be fed, to be housed, to be clothed, and trying to find a solution so they can go home",1
88,there are about 6 million people refugees or in danger of being refugees we cannot take all those people in so it makes sense to use our aid budget to try and help them in the region [and then help them get home],1
89,Thank you Rebecca for your question I think it's absolutely crucial,0
90,I think the most important thing is to make sure there are good jobs for people to do and honestly in the last Parliament we've created 2 million new jobs and in the next parliament we want to create 2 million more good jobs for people,1
91,"I think apprenticeships and universities are vital. I want our young people have the choice of either, so we're gonna have 3 million apprenticeships in the next parliament",1
92,but also we've uncapped university places so whoever wants a place can go to university,0
93,in terms of building homes I want us to build homes that people can afford to buy,1
94,"and that's what our starter homes are all about: put it 80% of the market price, not available to foreign buyers or investment funds, but they're for British people to buy and to own",0
95,"and with our help to buy, that has helped about 88000 people onto the housing ladder, we can make that a reality for people",1
96,now I know it seems odd to answer a question from a young person about pensions,0
97,but actually it is important to be able to look forward to security and dignity in old age and we've safeguarded the pension because people in our country should be able to look forward to dignity and security,1
98,but let me make a point about schools because actually under this government we got a million more children in good or outstanding schools,0
99,one of the reasons for that is that we've opened up the state education system and encouraged great education providers teachers and charities to come in and set up schools,0
100,"I was at one today, the Warrington King's Academy, 3 times more people want to go than they can take",0
101,and I think these free schools are a great institution but Ed Miliband's party says no more and is even contemplating shutting down some of the schools that are about to get going,1
102,I say we need more good school places and whether they are Academies or free schools or Universities,1
103,"you know with Nick Clegg we sat in the Cabinet Room together we took difficult decisions together and Nick I, like, defend all of the decisions we took",0
104,"I mean, that is the truth and young people suffer the most, when you have an economy with out-of-control debt, out-of-control welfare, out-of-control spending, young people suffer the most",1
105,"well I think there obviously has been a very difficult time, recovering from the appalling recession that we had it has been tough it has been difficult",0
106,"but Britain has still got some great strengths, we got a strong and growing economy we're creating jobs we're part of all these important networks in the world whether it's the G8, or NATO, or the European Union",1
107,"we have clout in the world, we can get things done in the world",1
108,think of what some of our people are doing right now: we got nurses in West Africa helping to deal with ebola we got some of those brave and professional Armed services anywhere in the world and tonight's a good moment to say thank you to them for all they do,0
109,"the lady makes an important point, which is: there are people who come out of our armed services who do have difficulties, and that's why we should be putting money into the armed forces charities that help homeless people and people also with mental health problems [when they come out of our armed service]",1
110,I mean I think Leanne makes a good point: we discovered today there about 70 Labour MPs that employ people on zero-hours contracts and so they obviously haven't got the bit about practising where they preach,0
111,"but there is a big point here: yesterday a hundred of business leaders from some of the most iconic business brands, large and small, said that the plan that we have is getting the country back to work, is getting the country on the right track",0
112,and if we go off with that with Ed Miliband's plan we put the country at risk the recovery at risk and jobs at risk,0
113,"I have been your Prime Minister for the last 5 years and all that time I've tried to have one task in mind above all others, and that has been: turning our economy around putting the country back to work and clearing up the mess that was left to us",1
114,I want to stand for another 5 years because I want us to finish the job that we've all started,0
115,we've created 2 million jobs let's create a job for everyone who wants and needs one,0
116,we cut the deficit in half let's clear it altogether and have Britain back in the black,0
117,we've invested in our National Health Service let's keep doing that and make sure it's a genuine service seven days a week for you and your family all year around,1
118,"what my plan is about is basically one word: security. security for you, for you family, for our country",1
119,this is an amazing country and we're on our way back,1
120,"and there's a fundamental choice of this election: stick with the plan with a team who brought that plan because it's working and it's helping, or put it all at risk by the people who gave us the spending the debt the taxes and the waste",0
121,"I say let's stick to the plan that's working, let's not go back to square one, let's finish what we started",0
122,I think it's pretty obvious that no one standing here is going to win this election outright so you're gonna have to choose like you did last time who's gonna have to work with whom,1
123,"and look, I'm not gonna pretend that everything's perfect, though the country's in a lot better shape now than it was 5 years ago",1
124,"I'm not even gonna pretend that I haven't made mistakes: I have, I've put my hands up when I have, and I've learned from them",0
125,but what you will get from me and from the Liberal Democrats is this: the grit and the resilience to finish the job of balancing the books and doing so fairly,0
126,"I will always act responsibly, I'll never let anyone else borrow money that we don't have and jeopardize your risk your jobs and our economy",0
127,"and above all, I will always act fairly",0
128,I won't let anyone else impose ideological cuts on your hospitals in your school,0
129,"and I will always serve the whole of our country, not just parts of our country: the whole of our wonderful United Kingdom",0
130,"Johnny, I think it's all about balance, isn't it?",0
131,"that's why I don't think that you should be faced, Johnny, with the stark choice of either cutting too much George Osborne and David Cameron's plan is for pounds 50bn of cuts: way beyond those needed or borrowing too much, which is Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's plan: they want to borrow pounds 70 bn more than is necessary",1
132,"I think it's a dismal choice, cutting too much or borrowing too much",1
133,"it's a balance, and it does mean, yes, you need to reduce spending but you also need to make those with the broader shoulders, the wealthiest, to pay a bit more through the tax system to balance the books",1
134,"that's the way you can balance the books, do it fairly, also then of course put money into public services, perhaps most especially the NHS which does need more money because of the fact we've got an ageing population",1
135,"so the Liberal Democrat plan is a very simple one: we'll cut less than the Conservatives, and we'll borrow less than Labour",0
136,"I have a question for David Cameron, because he's just said to all of us that he wants to stay the course",0
137,because that's not what the Conservative Party wants to do at all,0
138,"remarkably, the Conservative Party have said they're not gonna ask the richest in society to make a single extra penny of contribution to balancing the books through the tax system",0
139,they want to impose ideologically driven cuts on schools,0
140,"so I'd like you know I just when I hear the Conservatives talk about that choice between competence and chaos, just imagine, David Cameron the chaos in people's lives, the people who in the NHS don't know whether you're gonna find the money, why people who don't know whether their nursery or their college of their schools are going to close",0
141,"that's why Johnny's right, you need to take a balanced approach",1
142,"you do need to reduce spending but you also need to ask the richest to make a contribution, it's the only fair way of finishing",1
143,well I don't actually think making the poorest on this side of the planet poorer still is necessarily the best solution to our problems,1
144,"but look, it comes back to a simple issue: how do you balance the books but do it fairly",0
145,"I don't believe, unlike David Cameron and George Osborne, we should do it by just letting the very richest off scot free",1
146,their plans don't involve a single extra contributions to the tax system,0
147,"I don't equally think it is fair to do what the Labour Party wants to do, which is actually to increase borrowing: that doesn't help the future generations",1
148,David Cameron make much further cuts than is needed because they want to,0
149,"look, we've heard lots of warm words here about the NHS, of course we all love the NHS, but the NHS doesn't need warm words, it needs hard cash",1
150,"and I'll give you the precise number of how much extra cash it needs: it needs pounds 8 bn by the end of the next Parliament that is what a man called Simon Stevens, who runs NHS England, is independent of politics, has said it needs.",1
151,"now, the Liberal Democrats have a plan about how to find that pounds 8 bn",0
152,"unlike the Conservatives, we'll ask the richest to pay a little extra in tax for the NHS, closing the reliefs for instance in capital gains tax",0
153,"unlike the Labour, we'll also be able to put money in the NHS, cause we'll actually get the job done of balancing the books and then we can invest in the NHS",0
154,that is the way to balance the books and invest in the NHS,1
155,"this means pounds 8 bn more here, pounds 800 million more for the NHS in Scotland, and pounds 450 million more in Wales",0
156,"and I'll challenge the leaders here: if you love the NHS so much, why don't you put your money where your heart is",0
157,may I just I mean Terry asked how you're gonna safeguard the NHS for future generations,0
158,"and in view of this, Terry and I, we all know of our ageing population. The NHS is under greater pressure than is have been ever before",1
159,but it was a simple question who has got the plan to put pounds 8bn of additional money into the NHS,0
160,that's what all of us standing here have been told it requires,0
161,"you're not gonna get it in Scotland, the SNP have actually reduced the amount of money compared to what we've done in south of the border",0
162,and you're only gonna get it if you're going to ask the wealthiest to pay a small additional contribution,1
163,one other thing I'd like to say: mental health's for far too long been the poor cousin of physical health in the NHS,1
164,the more we can do to treat mental health in the same way that we've long treated physical health I think that will put NHS in good shape the future,1
165,"well look it is just simply not the case, is just simply not true that there's been some great push towards privatisation, it is simply not the case",1
166,"we legislated to outlaw the sweetheart deals which were entered into it with the private sector by the Labour government, as it happened",0
167,"when we took over 5 years ago the total amount of NHS money devoted to the private sector was 4%, it is now 6%",0
168,I don't call that the great sweeping act of privatization,0
169,"but all I would say is: it needs the money, 8bn, we need to prioritize mental health and we need to bring social care and health care together",1
170,cause we have too many elderly folk in hospital beds who should be discharged from hospital but don't have a place to go,0
171,"was I saying 5 years ago we inherited a situation where the previous Labour government had wasted pounds 250 million, can't deny this Ed Miliband, on sweetheart deals with private-sector contractors near NHS, which didn't help a single NHS patient",0
172,we outlawed that use of public money for private-sector contracts which are only based on price rather than quality,0
173,as I said earlier 4% under Labour was already devoted to the private sector,0
174,"I would suggest in this discussion we need three things to safeguard the NHS, which was Terry's original question first: money, pounds 8bn, my party has a plan to do so. secondly: give mental health the same importance and emphasis in the NHS as traditionally given to physical health and thirdly: make sure that when people, particularly elderly patients, are discharged from hospital, the social care system has a place for them to go",1
175,"oh I will never spread fear about immigration because I think we should remember this, there's basically good immigration and bad immigration",1
176,"and John in a bad immigration of course that needs to be stopped. That's why we've introduced new checks at the borders to bear down on illegal immigration, why we've increased the penalties against unscrupulous employers who employ people and exploit them from elsewhere, why people now who want to seek benefits have to learn English.",1
177,But there is also good immigration: we should remain a decent generous-hearted open-minded nation who welcomes people who want to come here play by the rules pay their taxes create jobs help in the NHS,1
178,"If we turn everybody away, the NHS will collapse overnight",1
179,so I guess my approach to immigration could be summarised simply as this: that I want Britain to be open for business but not open to abuse,1
180,"I think as far as immigration in the European Union is considered, firstly I'd say the freedom to move around the European Union should never be the same as the freedom to claim freedom to claim benefits on the first day you arrived no questions asking, get to split those two things off and that's something that we have done",1
181,"secondly, it is a two-way street: there are almost as many Brits living elsewhere and living and working elsewhere in the European Union European than there are Europeans working here",1
182,"and finally, if you want to make sure that our own youngsters get the jobs that other people from elsewhere in Europe might wanna get, you got to train them up, and one of the things I'm most proud of over the last 5 years is that we've now got 2 million people starting new apprenticeships: the biggest increase in apprenticeships since the last war and by the way over half of those are women starting apprenticeships so train up our own youngsters so that they get the jobs which they apply for here at home",1
183,"well I think the answer to that is to raise the minimum wage, which we are now doing so faster than we've ever done before, train up new apprenticeships, which we've done on a scale we never have done before",1
184,"but Nigel Farge talks about remember history, I mean, the Farage family were foreigners",0
185,the freedom to move around the European Union should not be the same as the freedom to claim,1
186,your problem is you seem to imply anyone who's foreigner who comes to this country is a menace,0
187,Nigel Farage seems to think that every single problem in the world could be solved by a referendum on Europe,0
188,"because at the end of the day Europe isn't perfect, of course it's not perfect",1
189,but it is the world's largest marketplace of 500 million shoppers who buy our goods and buy our services,0
190,"so if you do what Nigel Farage or a significant part of the Conservative Party want, which is to yank ourselves out of the family of Nations that makes up the European Union, unemployment will go up",1
191,"I would never ever ever endorse an approach which would make our country poorer and would see more people out of work, I think it is deeply irresponsible",1
192,"I strongly agree that apprentiships, which is an old idea, that idea that you sort of earn and learn, that you know you learn the tricks of the trade while you're actually working on the shop floor in the office or elsewhere is a great old idea that which we have given it new life",0
193,"we got 2 million new apprenticeships created over the course of this last parliament, it's never been expanded on such a scale",0
194,"and I think it's something that I hope all future parliaments will continue with, because it's a fantastic way to allow our youngsters to get their first",1
195,"Rebecca let me take the issue of tuition fees head on, I've caused famously, infamously, I couldn't put into practice my party's policy on tuition fees for reasons which, I hope, you're familiar with, they were introduced by Labour and actually checked up by Labour, and there was no money left",0
196,"but, we did the next best thing, got the fairest deal possible and thankfully now there're more young people going to university than ever before more on full time courses and there are more young people from disadvantaged backgrounds",0
197,"but if I couldn't do that I hope some fair minded folk would at least acknowledge many of the other things I'm very proud I have managed to do: to give more opportunities, to create a stronger economy, and a fairer society",0
198,"we've talked about more apprenticeships than ever before a huge tax cuts, which mean you pay nothing, no tax, on the first pounds 10600 you earn, as of next week a better money going to schools for the pupil premiumed for disadvantaged kids healthy meals at lunch time for little children at primary school these are the things which make a fairer future for future generations, and I'm very very proud of them",1
199,why is the Conservative party planning to cut the money for schools?,0
200,you're planning to cut over pounds 3bn out of the schools budget,0
201,that is no way to guarantee fairness,1
202,"I remember vividly, when your party wanted to cut spending for the schools at the beginning of last parliament and I said no",0
203,"cause you don't make society fairer by cutting the money that go to nurseries, colleges and schools",1
204,"you know, I got this sort of pious stance from Ed Miliband",0
205,"this is the man who is part of the government that said no boom-and-bust in the economy, and crashed our economy, jeopardizing the future generations and life chances of millions of people this country",0
206,"I have apologized, I've taken responsibility for the mistakes I've made,",0
207,"why don't you, in front of the British people, Ed Miliband, apologize say I'm sorry for crushing the British economy",0
208,"on the housing point, is a very important point, cause Rebecca I'm sure is in keeping with lots and lots of young people worried, that you're not gonna be able to get your feet on the first rung of the property ladder",1
209,the Liberal Democrats we got I think an idea which I hope will help Rebecca and it is this:,0
210,at the moment lots and lots of young people can't afford the deposit to get a mortgage on a property,0
211,"so what we would do is to introduce a rent-to-own scheme where you wouldn't need to find a deposit to buy a house, but every time you pay your rent at market rates you'd build up a share of ownership in your home so by renting you become over time an owner in your home",0
212,"I think that would be a great great way, which can introduce in the next Parliament, to give people like Rebecca the tangible belief that they can hope to live in a home which they can call their own",1
213,the only way we're going to instill optimism is if you wipe the slite slate clean for the next generation,1
214,we have to release Rebecca and her generation of the debt and the deficit of this generation,1
215,"I don't want Rebecca, I don't want my own kids I don't want any of our children to pay the price for this generation's mistake",1
216,"and if I can leave Rebecca and everybody with just one figure in mind, one statistic pounds 46bn: that is what we as a country will spend next year just paying off the interest on our debts",0
217,just imagine the number the hundreds of thousands of homes we could build for pounds 46bn,0
218,pounds 46bn is the same as pounds 700 for every man woman or child in this country,0
219,"and that is why I when I hear some leaders implying that we shouldn't somehow get rid of our deficit, I say look, if you don't do that, it's a bit like Miriam and me said, we're not going to pay off our credit card bill and we'll get our little kids to pay for us",1
220,well thank you for sitting through this 2 hour political marathon,0
221,"and I just have one more thing to ask of you and it is this: when you vote make sure that you decide what's right for you and your family, make sure that you do what's right for our country",0
222,"but above all make sure that we don't lurch this way or that, make sure that we don't borrow too much on the one hand or we cut too much on the other",0
223,"in other words, make sure that when you vote we keep our country stable and strong and fair",0
224,"and the only way we can do that is by finishing the job, finishing it fairly, balancing the books, doing it fairly, and putting money into our public services",1
225,"because that's the only way that we can create the society that I imagine we all want: a society where we have a stronger economy, and a fairer society where there is opportunity for everyone",1
226,Here's what I believe: Britain succeeds when working people succeed. But that's not the way it's been over the last five years.,1
227,"For five years, wages haven't kept up with bills.",0
228,"For five years, the NHS has been going backwards.",0
229,"For five years, our young people have been fearing of having a worse life than their parents.",0
230,It doesn't have to be this way.,1
231,"If I'm Prime Minister, I'll raise the minimum wage to pounds 8 an hour, and ban exploitative zero-hours contracts so I'll reward hard work again in our country.",0
232,"If I'm Prime Minister, I'll rescue our NHS, hiring more doctors and nurses.",0
233,"if I'm Prime Minister, I'll build a future for all of our young people, saying to our young people: ""If you get the grades get an apprenticeship,"" and cutting the tuition fees from pounds 9000 to pounds 6000",0
234,I will cut the deficit every year and balance the books.,0
235,"Some people'll tell you tonight: ""This is as good as it gets for Britain.""",0
236,"I say: ""Britain could do so much better than it's done over the last 5 years.""",1
237,"Johnny, we'll cut the deficit every year and as I said in the opening we will balance the books, but we'll do it in a fairer and better way than it's been tried over the last 5 years.",0
238,David Cameron promised to eliminate the deficit and he failed,0
239,"So what we'll do is, first of all we'll have fair taxes, so we'll reverse the tax cut that he gave to millionaires, pounds 43000 to every millionaire in Britain;",0
240,"secondly we will have common sense spending reductions, so outside key areas like education and health spending will fall;",0
241,but thirdly we'll do something else:,0
242,"because your living standards have fallen over the past five years, and it hasn't just been bad for working people,",0
243,"it's also meant the government hasn't had the tax revenues coming in, that's why this government failed on the deficit.",0
244,"So what we'll do is by boosting living standards, that's the third part of a plan, to live within our means, get the deficit down and balance the books",0
245,"It's a fair way, it's a better way, for our country.",1
246,I think not the first time tonight David Cameron hasn't wanted to talk about the past but he doesn't want to talk about the future,0
247,but David you just said that you were tackling tax avoidance,0
248,"Let's look at the reality on this: you haven't acted on the tax havens, you haven't acted on the hedge funds,",0
249,will you show how you can raise over pounds 1 billion as well as about pounds 2.5bn Time to Care Fund for the NHS,0
250,"it'll hire 20000 more nurses, 8000 more doctors, 5000 more careworkers, and 3000 more midwives",0
251,"now, you have to ask yourself at home, why won't David Cameron act on those hedge funds? they fund his party",0
252,"You're gonna hear all the scaremongering tonight, from Nick Clegg and from David Cameron",0
253,that's because they're scared that you're gonna kick them out,0
254,ah now look: I think is a big decision for our country,1
255,David Cameron wants to double the cuts in spending next year,0
256,at home you've got to make a decision: is that really a balanced plan?,0
257,I think that would put at risk the NHS which is gone backwards under David Cameron,1
258,"I think it's much better to have a fair plan which says those with the broader shoulders should bear the greatest burden, and we will make reductions in spending",1
259,"there you go again! you can't talk about the present, and you can't talk about the future, so you'd want to talk about the past",0
260,"I think people at home will want to know what do we gonna do for them in the next 5 years, not talking about the past",0
261,you backed our spending plans until 2008 it so happens,0
262,"but let's talk about the future, let's talk about the choices for working families in the future",0
263,"how are we gonna have fairer taxes, so those with the broader shoulders bear the greatest burden?",0
264,are we gonna have common sense reductions in spending?,0
265,"no I don't Leanne, and let me tell you about the differences between me and David Cameron as you've raised this point and it is an important point",0
266,"he refuses to have a mansion tax on the most expensive homes, about pounds 2 million, to fund the NHS, and instead he chooses to keep the bedroom tax",0
267,"I'll have a mansion tax, I'll also have a bankers bonus tax put our young people back to work",0
268,"I will make fair choices, much fairer choices than him",0
269,"and he wants to go much further on the deficit, he wants to go much further on spending cuts",0
270,"and that will mean not just that we balance the books but go further, and that will mean a crushing impact on public service",1
271,two weeks ago we had a vote against Torial austerity,0
272,"I do think we've seen the choice tonight Jillie because, I said I'll cut the deficit every year and we'll balance the books",0
273,I said there'll have to be spending reductions outside key areas like the NHS and education,1
274,"David Cameron has an extreme plan, he's failed in his plan and wants to go much much further",0
275,I'm not gonna stand on the stage tonight and don't say they don't need to be difficult decisions,0
276,"cuts will have to come, but we can do it in a balanced way, we can do it in a fair way",1
277,"Terry, like so many people around the country I'm deeply concerned about what I see happening in our National Health Service because we see people waiting longer for their test results, longer in A&E, longer to see a GP, longer to have an operation. We've got to turn it round",1
278,and when you hear from us leaders tonight I think at home you should ask: Where specifically is the money coming from?,0
279,"I'll tell you: we're gonna have a mansion tax on the most expensive homes, about pounds 2 million, and that's a clear promise from us",0
280,"we're going to get money from those hedge funds who're engaging in tax avoidance, and we're gonna get money from the tobacco companies, for a pounds 2.5bn Time to Care Fund",0
281,"that will hire 20000 more nurses, 8000 more doctors, 5000 more careworkers, and 3000 more midwives",0
282,"and it's not just more staff, because it's also joining up services from home to hospital, taking on the biggest challenge our NHS faces, which is an aging population cause if people can't get in to see the GP or can't be looked after at home, they end up in A&E, it's a plan to turn the NHS around",1
283,"Nigel, of course we have to look at those issues and deal with them, but I really don't believe that that is at the root of all the problems of the National Health Service",1
284,"and I don't want to pick up on something David Cameron said, but he said he'd protected the NHS",0
285,I'll ask you at home to decide whether this is what protection looks like,0
286,a million people waited last year in A&E for more than 4 hours,0
287,we've got ambulances queuing outside our Accident & Emergency units,0
288,we're missing the targets for cancer treatment for the first time ever,0
289,"and to add to that, we had a tent, a tent erected in the hospital car park to treat people in 2015 in our United Kingdom",0
290,"I do not believe that is protecting the NHS, and his spending plans for the next parliament are even more dangerous for our National Health Service",1
291,"I'll just say on this Leanne, my two sons were born in a PFI hospital, and it was an old, falling down hospital",0
292,"but you're right, there need to be limits to privatization",1
293,"that's why we said we'll roll back the tide of privatisation that is starting under David Cameron, and is about to go much much further",0
294,we'll cut the profits of the private sector,0
295,he said he's protected the NHS and he said he kept his word,0
296,David you made a whole series of promises at the last general election to people,0
297,"you said no top down reorganization, you didn't listen to the staff, and that's exactly what happened",0
298,you said no going back to the days when people had to wait hours on end in A&E and that's exactly what happened,0
299,"I don't think people will take seriously your promises on the NHS, because you broke all the promises you made at the last general elections",0
300,"you supported the Health and Social Care Act, which is the recipe for privatisation of our NHS",1
301,"but there's a bigger issue for people at home, and that's future plans for the NHS",0
302,I've set out where the money's coming from,0
303,"David Cameron is planning to double the spending cuts next year, and bigger cuts in the next 3 years",0
304,"think what that would mean not just for the NHS, but social care",0
305,"if you cut social care dramatically, as has happened in this Parliament, you undermine the NHS fundamentally because elderly people don't get the help in their own home, they end up in hospital, and the NHS is creaking at the seams",1
306,"that is what is happening now, imagine what it would be like with another five years of David Cameron",0
307,"well look, I would say to everybody at home that: use your vote in this election as a weapon to fight for the future of our National Health Service",0
308,"I've got to say, over 13 years our Labor government transformed the NHS from 18 month waiting to 18 week waiting",0
309,"that's our record, and now it's going backwards on your watch.",1
310,"you failed the British people, you've broken your bond of trust on the National Health System. They believed you, they believed you",0
311,"look, people at home'll have to decide. I think the NHS is the foundation for working families in our country",1
312,that's why my plan says: only when working people succeed that Britain succeed,1
313,"David Cameron wants to tell you it's all got a lot better, he wants to congratulate himself, patting himself on the back, saying he's done a great job",0
314,you've got to decide about what your experiences and what you see in the NHS,0
315,John thank you for your question,0
316,I changed Labour's approach on immigration because I don't think it's prejudiced to worry about immigration,1
317,"I think people's concerns are real and they've got to be dealt with, and I want to explain how we'll deal with them",1
318,if I'm elected as Prime Minister we'll put in place new rules which say that if you come to this country you won't get benefits for at least the first two years,0
319,"I will also do something else, which I think is of concern to many people in our country we'll stop the undercutting of wages and conditions that happens so often",1
320,employers exploiting migrant labour not paying the minimum wage recruiting only from abroad to undercut wages,0
321,"there've been just two prosecutions for failure to pay the minimum wage in the last 5 years: we've got to deal with it, and if I'm prime minister, I will",1
322,"there's one other thing I'll say to you there: if you want a party that will cut Britain off from the rest of the world, that's not me",1
323,"I believe we've got to play our role in the world, but if you want to party with controls on immigration, that's what I offer",1
324,"David, I'm wondering what world do you live in",0
325,you talked about your negotiating skill in Europe. You made a big stand against the President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker,0
326,"you lost by 26 votes to 2, because you had no allies",1
327,and the problem is: David Cameron has marginalized us in Europe,1
328,"now, I just want to be honest with people at home",0
329,"there're false promises you get from David Cameron, he stood on this stage 5 years ago and set net migration into the tens of thousands, and yet he said: ""Kick me out!"" if I fail to deliver-well, I suggest you do but he failed on that promise, and he's gonna make that promise again and there's false solutions from Nigel Farage. I'm just gonna be frank with people: I don't think our place lies outside of the European Union",1
330,"I think that'll be a disaster for jobs, I think that'll be a disaster for families and businesses",1
331,"let's change Europe so it works better for us including on immigration, but let's not sacrifice jobs businesses and families",0
332,David Cameron said earlier that work pays in our country: Rubbish! Work doesn't pay in our country!,0
333,"there are so many people around our country, millions of people, people watching at home tonight, who are going out doing all the hours that God sends, and who can't feed their family, can't make ends meet at the end of the month",0
334,"and let's take the issue of zero-hours contracts, because it's relevant to this debate",0
335,"if work is insecure, if work doesn't pay properly, then you don't get the security that working people need",1
336,now I say we should deal with those exploitative zero-hours contacts. It's an absolutely crucial part of this immigration debate,1
337,"because you've got to create security for the working families of Britain, and that's what I will do",1
338,"my priority as a Prime Minister is to tackle the cost of living crisis, sort our NHS, and build a future for our young people",1
339,"and look, you know, the British people have a decision to make tonight, and at the general election",0
340,"David Cameron will spend the next 2 years deciding whether to exit the European Union, something he doesn't even want to do: he says he wants to stay in the European Union!",0
341,"so look, I say, there's better priorities for our country and they'll be my priorities as a Prime Minister",1
342,"well we did get it wrong, and I've said we got it wrong, and I've changed our approach",0
343,but I do think there's a wider issue here about the opportunity for our young people. Nick and David were saying how brilliant everything is on apprenticeships,1
344,take an issue: IT,0
345,"we import lot we bring lots of people into this country, who are contributing to our country from other countries, with special skills in IT",0
346,but apprenticeships in IT are actually falling in our country,0
347,well the answer is: we should say that if you want to bring in a skilled worker from outside the European Union you must provide apprenticeships to the next generation,1
348,because homegrown opportunity is an essential part of dealing with people's concerns,1
349,"Rebecca, you speak for so many young people right across our country so many young people I meet, who are asking why they're paying the price of hard times",0
350,"and that's what we've got to turn round, and that's what I'm going to do if I'm your Prime Minister",1
351,"look, the first thing we've got to do is we've got to guarantee all young people access to good education so you get a high-quality apprenticeship if you get the grades, that's a guarantee the next Labour government will make and also cut the tuition fee from pounds 9000 to pounds 6000 because I don't want our young people drowning in debt when they leave University",1
352,"next we've got to create good jobs for young people, that's why I will ban the exploitation of zero-hours contracts",1
353,"I will say: if you do regular hours, you get a regular contract",0
354,and lastly we'll build homes again in our country,0
355,200000 homes a year by 2020 and get a fair deal for young people in the private rented sector where many young people are being ripped off,0
356,I believe in what I call the promise of Britain: that the next generation does better than the last. I believe we can restore it,1
357,I think I would say to David Cameron is of course his scares about free school are wrong,0
358,"we do not want a system in the future which has unqualified teachers, 17000 unqualified teachers in our schools",1
359,but there is a bigger issue because Rebecca who asks the questions was about asking about young people going into the world today,0
360,and you've heard David Cameron and Nick Clegg defend a system which ensures that young people leave University with pounds 44000 with a debt,0
361,"he didn't have to leave school with pounds 44000 with a debt, nor did he, now nor did I",0
362,but the difference with me is: I'm gonna do something about it. I'm gonna cut the tuition fee. Would I like to go further than pounds 6000? Of course I would,0
363,but is a costed plan to reduce the tuition fee,0
364,"and Nick, you're describing a broken promise as the next best thing-and I'm gonna try and remember that for the future-but you know, it was a broken promise",0
365,"and let me just point this out: David, when you were in opposition at the time, as leader of the opposition you were saying the banks were overregulated, so I'm really not gonna take any lectures from you about the global financial crisis",0
366,"I want to pick up on something that's very important to young people, which is: renting in the private sector",1
367,"lots of young people have this experience, it's incredibly insecure, it's sometimes substandard accommodation",0
368,"and we're the only party with a plan to get a fair deal in the private rented sector 3-year tenancies, not one-year tenancies, rent stabilized during that time, and stopping letting agents charging tenants, because at the moment they charge tenants and landlords fees",0
369,and that is a massive issue for young people all across our country and we will act,1
370,"but is all part of saying, look, we've got to stand up somebody's powerful interests and actually make this country work for young people",1
371,I shall be very practical about this. What's one of the most important things for our young people? the quality of jobs.,1
372,"we'got 700000 people in our country on zero-hours contracts, probably some people watching tonight at home, waiting for that text message to say whether you have work tomorrow",0
373,and David Cameron says he couldn't live on a zero-hours contract. Well nor could I David.,0
374,"but the difference with me is I'm going to do something about it. I'm gonna legislate, so if you do regular hours you get a regular contract not a zero-hours contract",0
375,and it goes to what kind of country we build: do we build a country with security for working families and for our young people?,0
376,"there is a big choice in this general election: he thinks that as long as a few corporations and individuals do well, the richest and most powerful, the wealth would trickle down to everyone else",0
377,"well, he would try that experiment over the last 5 years",0
378,"you've heard from 7 leaders tonight, but there's one fundamental choice at this election do we build a Britain that puts working people first, or do we carry on with a government that is not on your side?",0
379,"if I'm Prime Minister I'll make sure we'll reward the hard work of everybody in our country, not just those who get the six-figure bonuses",0
380,if I'm Prime Minister I'll take on those energy companies that are ripping you off,0
381,if I'm Prime Minister everyone will play by the same rules. We won't give the green light to tax avoidance,0
382,"and if I'm Prime Minister we'll cut the deficit every year, balance the books, but will protect health and education",0
383,there is a big choice at this election,1
384,I believe that it is when working people succeed that Britain succeed,1
385,"if you believe that too, I ask for your support, and let's bring the change that Britain needs",0
