2126,One that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past and an attempt to take us backward.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/1027.wav,
2127,But we're not going back.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/1028.wav,

2129,And we can chart a new way forward.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/1030.wav,
2130,"And a vision of that includes having a plan, understanding the aspirations, the dreams, the hopes, the ambition of the American people, which is why I intend to create  an opportunity economy, investing in small businesses, in new families, in what we can do around protecting seniors, what we can do that is about giving hardworking folks a break and bringing down the cost of living.",/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/1031.wav,

2135,"I've only had one client, the people.",/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/1036.wav,
