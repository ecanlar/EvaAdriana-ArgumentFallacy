I just need to respond one time to what he has said multiple times.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/917.wav,,1
Obamacare was lousy health care.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/918.wav,,1
Always was.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/919.wav,,1

"We had some real bad ones, too, and so do they.",/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/938.wav,,1
They have really bad ones.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/939.wav,,1
The difference is they don't get rid of them.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/940.wav,,1
But let me just explain.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/941.wav,,1

And what we will do is we're looking at different plans.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/947.wav,,1
"If we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population, less money, and be better healthcare than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it.",/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/948.wav,,1

And there are concepts and options we have to do that.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/953.wav,,1
And you'll be hearing about it in the not too distant future.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/954.wav,,1

You have no plan.,/mnt/c/users/evacantin/desktop/MASTER/HAIA/Trabajo/MMUSED-fallacy/audio_clips/48_2024/970.wav,,1
