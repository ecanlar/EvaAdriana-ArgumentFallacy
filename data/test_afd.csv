We got to take a look at what I was left when I became president and what Mr. Trump left me.,
We had an economy that was in free fall.,
The pandemic was so badly handled.,
Many people were dying.,
"All he said was, it's not that serious.",
Just inject a little bleach into your arm.,
You'll be all right.,
The economy collapsed.,
There were no jobs.,
Unemployment rate rose to 15%.,
It was terrible.,
And so what we had to do is try to put things back together again.,
That's exactly what we began to do.,
"We created 15,000 new jobs.",
"We brought out another position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.",
But there's more to be done.,
There's more to be done.,
Working class people are still in trouble.,
"I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania.",
I come of household.,
We're at a kitchen table.,
"If things weren't able to be met during the month, it was a problem.",
"Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.",
That's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems and we're going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing.,
We're going to make sure we build 2 million new units.,
We're going to make sure we cap rents so corporate greed can't take over.,
The combination of what I was left with in corporate greed is the reason why we're in this problem right now.,
"In addition to that, we're in a situation where if you take a look at all that was done in his administration,  He didn't do much at all.",
"By the time he left, there were things were in chaos, literally chaos.",
And so we put things back together.,
"We created, I said, those jobs.",
"We make sure we had a situation where we now we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people to $15 for for a insulin shot as opposed to $400.",
"No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they can include beginning next year.",
"And the situation is making, and we're going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans.",
"So we're working to bring down the price around the kitchen table, and that's what we're going to get done.",
Thank you.,
President Trump?,
We had the greatest economy in the history of our country.,
We have never done so well.,
Everybody was amazed by it.,
Other countries were copying us.,
We got hit with COVID.,
"And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression, the likes of which we had in 1929.  by the time we finished, so we did a great job.",
"We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things.",
Everything was rocking good.,
But the thing we never got the credit for and we should have is getting us out of that COVID mess.,
He created mandates.,
That was a disaster for our country.,
"But other than that, we had given them back a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible.",
"The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs, a bounce back from the COVID.",
He has not done a good job.,
He's done a poor job.,
And inflation is killing our country.,
It is absolutely killing us.,
" Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he's the only one who thinks that, I think.",
I don't know anybody else who thinks he had the greatest economy in the world.,
"And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we plant ourselves in a situation where his economy, he rewarded the wealthy.",
"He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion.",
He raised a deficit larger than any president has in any one term.,
"He's the only president other than Herbert Hoover who's lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover.",
"The idea that he did something that was significant, and the military, you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan.",
He didn't do anything about that.,
"When he was president, we were still finding ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country.",
"The truth is, I'm the only president this century  that doesn't have any, this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world like he did.",
Am I allowed to respond to him?,
" not going to drive them higher it's just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years like china and many others in all fairness to china it's going to just force them to pay us a lot of money reduce our deficit tremendously and give us a lot of power for other things but he would he made a statement the only thing he was right about is i gave you the largest tax cut in history i also gave you the largest regulation cut in history that's why we had all the jobs  and the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he's taking credit for bounce back jobs you can't do that he also said he inherited nine percent inflation now he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months and then it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like  a bunch of people that didn't know what they were doing, and they don't know what they were doing.",
"It was the worst, probably the worst administration in history.",
There's never been.,
"And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power.",
He got out.,
It was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country's life.,
 Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we've ever seen just prior to COVID.,
"And even after COVID, it was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country.",
"But we spurred, that tax spurred.",
"Now, when we cut the taxes, as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39%, plus beyond that.",
"We took in more revenue with much less tax, and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country.",
"The country was going like never before, and we were ready to start paying down debt.",
"We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet.",
We were going to have something that nobody else has had.,
We got hit with COVID.,
We did a lot to fix it.,
I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with.,
We gave him something great.,
"Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it.",
"More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it, something which a lot of people don't like to talk about.",
But he had far more people dying in his administration.,
"He did the mandate, which is a disaster, mandating it.",
The vaccine went out.,
"He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine.",
"and he did a very poor job just a very poor job and i will tell you not only poor there but throughout the entire world we're no longer respected as a country they don't respect our leadership they don't respect the united states anymore we're like a third world nation between weaponization of his election trying to go after his political opponent all of the things he's done we've become like a third world nation and it's a shame the damage he's done to our country  And I'd love to ask him and will why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.",
" He had the largest national debt of any president in a four-year period, number one.",
"Number two, that $2 trillion tax cut benefited the very wealthy.",
What I'm going to do is fix the tax system.,
"For example, we have 1,000 billionaires in America.",
And what's happening?,
"They're in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2% in taxes.",
"If they just paid 24% or 25%, either one of those numbers, they'd raise $500 million, billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.",
We'd be able to wipe out his debt.,
"We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do, childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person  eligible for what I've been able to do with the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.",
" Well, he's right.",
He did beat Medicare.,
"He beat it to death, and he's destroying Medicare because all of these people are coming in.",
They're putting them on Medicare.,
They're putting them on Social Security.,
They're going to destroy Social Security.,
This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security.,
These millions and millions of people coming in  They're trying to put them on Social Security.,
He will wipe out Social Security.,
He will wipe out Medicare.,
"So he was right in the way he finished that sentence, and it's a shame.",
What's happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed.,
"Foreign countries, I'm friends with a lot of people, they cannot believe what happened to the United States of America.",
We're no longer respected.,
They don't like us.,
"We give them everything they want, and they think we're stupid.",
They think we're very stupid people.,
"What we're doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us.",
What this man has done is absolutely criminal.,
" First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion bill.",
And I agree with their decision to have done that.,
And I will not block it.,
"And if you look at this whole question that you're asking, complex but not really complex, 51 years ago,  You had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states.",
"Everybody, without exception.",
"Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives.",
Everybody wanted it back.,
Religious leaders.,
"And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states.",
This is something that everybody wanted.,
"now 10 years ago or so they started talking about how many weeks and how many this getting into other things but every legal scholar throughout the world the most respected wanted it brought back to the states i did that now the states are working it out if you look at ohio it was a decision that was it was a an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought  Kansas, I would say the same thing.",
Texas is different.,
Florida is different.,
But they're all making their own decisions right now.,
"And right now, the states control it.",
That's the vote of the people.,
"Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions.",
I am a person that believes.,
"And frankly, I think it's important to believe in the exceptions.",
"Some people, you have to follow your heart.",
Some people don't believe in that.,
"But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.",
I think it's very important.,
"Some people don't follow your heart, but you have to get elected also.",
"And because that has to do with other things, you got to get elected.",
"The problem they have is they're radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month and even after birth.",
"After birth, if you look at the former governor of Virginia,  He was willing to do this.",
"He said, we'll put the baby aside and we'll determine what we do with the baby, meaning we'll kill the baby.",
What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue.,
It's been a great thing.,
Thank you.,
President Biden?,
"It's been a terrible thing, what you've done.",
The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided.,
Supported Roe.,
And that's this idea that they're all against it.,
It's just ridiculous.,
And this is the guy who says the state should be able to have it.,
"We're in a state where in six weeks, you don't even know whether you're pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help.",
"The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we're going to turn civil rights back to the states.",
Let each state have a different rule.,
"Look, there's so many young women who have been, including a young woman who just was murdered, and he went to the funeral.",
"And the idea that she was murdered by an immigrant coming in, they talk about that.",
But here's the deal.,
"There's a lot of young women to be raped by their in-laws, by their spouses.",
brothers and sisters by just it's just ridiculous and they can do nothing about it and they try to arrest them when they cross state lines.,
 There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border.,
We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.,
Considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.,
"And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country.",
And they are raping and killing women.,
And it's a terrible thing.,
"As far as the abortion is concerned, it is now back with the states.",
The states are voting.,
"In many cases, it's frankly a very liberal decision.",
"In many cases, it's the opposite.",
"But they're voting, and it's bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders if they knew about this issue, which, frankly, they didn't.",
But everybody wanted it brought back.,
Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back.,
He wasn't able to get it.,
"Everybody wanted it brought back, and many presidents had tried to get it back.",
I was the one to do it.,
"And, again, this gives it the vote of the people, and that's where they wanted it.",
Every legal scholar wanted it that way.,
"I support Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters.",
The first time is between the woman and the doctor.,
Second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation.,
"The third time is between the doctor, I mean, between the woman and the state.",
"The idea that the politicians, that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about women's health is ridiculous.",
That's the last.,
No politician should be making that decision.,
A doctor should be making those decisions.,
That's how it should be run.,
That's what you're going to do.,
"And if I'm elected, I'm going to restore Roe v. Wade.",
" So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth because some states, Democrat run, take it after birth.",
"Again, the governor, former governor of Virginia, put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it.",
"So he's willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.",
"Nobody wants that to happen, Democrat or Republican.",
Nobody wants it to happen.,
 That is simply not true.,
The Roe v. Wade does not provide for that.,
That's not the circumstance.,
"Only if a woman's life is in danger, she's going to die.",
That's the only circumstance in which that can happen.,
"But we are not for late-term abortion, period, period, period.",
" Under Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abortion.",
"You can do whatever you want, depending on the state.",
You can do whatever you want.,
We don't think that's a good thing.,
We think it's a radical thing.,
"We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans.",
"For 51 years, that was the law.",
"Fifty-one years, Constance's Scholarship said it was the right way to go.",
"Fifty-one years, and it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court.",
He takes credit for taking it away.,
What's he going to do?,
"What's he going to do, in fact, if the MAGA Republicans, he gets elected and the MAGA Republicans control the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or ten weeks, something very, very conservative.",
Is he going to sign that bill?,
I'll veto it.,
He'll sign it.,
" Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now.",
We significantly increased  the number of asylum officers significantly.,
"By the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me, endorsed my position.",
"In addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where when he was present, he was taking, separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated.",
That's not the right way to go.,
"What I've done since I've changed the law, what's happened, I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.",
That's better than when he left office.,
And I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers.,
 President Trump?,
I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence.,
I don't think he knows what he said either.,
"Look, we had the safest border in the history of our country.",
All he had to do was leave it.,
All he had to do was leave it.,0.0
"He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are  from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists.",
"We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now, all terrorists, all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world.",
"They come from the Middle East, everywhere.",
"All over the world, they're pouring in.",
"and this guy just left it open and he didn't need legislation because i didn't have legislation i said close the border we had the safest border in history in that final couple of months of my presidency we had according to border patrol who is great and by the way who endorsed me for president but i won't say that but they endorsed me for president  Brandon, just speak to him.",
"But look, we had the safest border in history.",
Now we have the worst border in history.,
There's never been anything like it.,
"And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up.",
" The only terrorist who's done anything across the border is one who came along and killed three under his administration, killed an Al Qaeda person coming in and his administration, killed three American soldiers, killed three American soldiers.",
That's the only terrorist that's there.,
"I'm not saying no terrorist ever got through, but the idea they're emptying their prisons, we're welcoming these people.",
That's simply not true.,
There's no data to support what he said.,
"Once again, he's exaggerating.",
He's lying.,
Just one second.,
He said we kill three people.,
"The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world.",
"And it had a huge impact on everything, not just border, on everything.",
"He's the one that killed people with the bad water, including  hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come in.",
We are living right now in a rat's nest.,
"They're killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union because we don't have borders anymore.",
Every state is now a border.,
"And because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen.",
We call it migrant crime.,
I call it Biden migrant crime.,
They're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen before.,
And you're reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days.,
one of them i just spoke to the mother and he just had the funeral for this girl 12 years old this is horrible what's taken place what's taken place in our country we're literally an uncivilized country now he doesn't want it to be he just doesn't know he opened the borders nobody's ever seen anything like and we have to get a lot of these people out or we have to get them out fast because they're going to destroy our country just take a look at where they're living  They're living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places.,
Our veterans are on the street.,
They're dying because he doesn't care about our veterans.,
He doesn't care.,
He doesn't like the military at all.,
And he doesn't care about our veterans.,
Nobody been worse.,
I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care of the VA.,
He has the worst.,
He's gotten rid of all the things that I approved.,
"Choice, that I got through Congress, all of the different things I approved, they abandoned.",
"We had by far the highest, and now it's down in less than half because he's done all these great things that we did.",
"And I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy.",
But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing all of these people to come in.,
And it's a very sad day in America.,
 Every single thing he said is a lie.,
Every single one.,
"For example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act.",
One million of them now have insurance and their families have it.,
"Their families have it because what happened, whether it was Agent Orange or burn pits, they're all being covered now.",
And his group opposed that.,
We're also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans.,
My son spent a year in Iraq.,
"living next to one of those burn pits, came back with stage four glioblastoma.",
"I was recently in France for D-Day, and I spoke about those heroes that died.",
"I went to the World War II cemetery, World War I cemetery he refused to go to.",
"He was standing with his four-star general, and he told me, he said, I don't want to go in there because there are a bunch of losers and suckers.",
"My son was not a loser, was not a sucker.",
You're the sucker.,
You're the loser.,
President Trump?,
"First of all, that was a made-up quote, suckers and losers.",
They made it up.,
"It was in a third-rate magazine that's failing, like many of these magazines.",
He made that up.,
He put it in commercials.,
We've notified him.,
We had 19 people that said I didn't say it.,
And think of this.,
Who would say I'm at a cemetery or I'm talking about our veterans?,
Because nobody's taking better care.,
"I'm so glad this came up, and he brought it up.",
There's nobody that's taken better care of our soldiers than I have.,
"To think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers.",
We have 19 people that said it was never said by me.,
"It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up.",
"Just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking, it's the same thing.",
51 intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation.,
It wasn't.,
"That came from his son, Hunter.",
It wasn't Russia disinformation.,
"He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now.",
" Four-star general standing to your side who was on your staff who said you said it, period.",
That's number one.,
"And number two, the idea, the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the line.",
We've done more for veterans than any president has in American history.,
American history.,
And they now are in their family.,
The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home and their families and equip them when they go to war.,
That's what we're doing.,
That's what the VA is doing now.,
They're doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.,
"First of all,  Our veterans and our soldiers can't stand this guy.",
They can't stand him.,
"They think he's the worst commander in chief, if that's what you call him, that we've ever had.",
They can't stand him.,0.0
So let's get that straight.,
And they like me more than just about any of them.,
And that's based on every single bit of information.,
"As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, the president that knew that was respected by Putin,  he would have never he would have never invaded ukraine a lot of people are dead right now much more than people know you know they talk about numbers you can double those numbers maybe triple those numbers  He did nothing to stop it.",
"In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.",
I'll tell you what happened.,
He was so bad with Afghanistan.,
"It was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned.",
"And so he's got no love lost, but he should have fired those generals.",
No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment.,
"moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind.",
"We lost 13 beautiful soldiers, and 38 soldiers were obliterated.",
"And by the way, we left people behind, too.",
We left American citizens behind.,
"When Putin saw that, he said, you know what?",
I think we're going to go in and maybe take my—this was his dream.,
"I talked to him about it, his dream.",
"The difference is, he never would have invaded  ukraine never just like israel would have never been invaded in a million years by hamas you know why because iran was broke with me i wouldn't let anybody do business with them they ran out of money they were broke they had no money for hamas they had no money for anything no money for terror that's why you had no terror at all during my administration this place the whole world is blowing up under him president biden",
" never heard so much malarkey in my whole life look the fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where let's take the last point first iran attacked american troops kill caused brain damage for a number of these troops and he did nothing about it recently when he was president there they attacked he said they're just having headaches that's all it is but he didn't do a thing when the attack took place number one number two  We got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift.",
"Number three, we found ourselves in a situation where if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine,  This guy told Trump, do whatever you want and do whatever you want.",
"And that's exactly what Trump did to Putin, encourage him, do whatever you want.",
And he went in.,
And listen to what he said when he went in.,
"He was going to take Kiev in five days, remember, because it's part of the old Soviet Union.",
"That's what he wanted to reestablish, Kiev.",
"And he, in fact, didn't do it at all.",
He wasn't able to get it done.,
"And they've lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops.",
"No, they're not acceptable.",
"But look, this is a war that never should have started.",
"If we had a leader in this war, he led everybody along.",
He's given $200 billion now or more  to Ukraine.,
He's given $200 billion.,
That's a lot of money.,
I don't think there's ever been anything like it.,
"Every time that Zelensky comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion.",
He's the greatest salesman ever.,
And I'm not knocking him.,
I'm not knocking anything.,
I'm only saying the money that we're spending on this war  And we shouldn't be spending.,
It should have never happened.,
I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelensky as president-elect before I take office on January 20th.,
I'll have that war settled.,
"People being killed so needlessly, so stupidly.",
"And I will get it settled, and I'll get it settled fast before I take office.",
"President Biden, you have a minute.",
 The fact is that Putin is a war criminal.,
He's killed thousands and thousands of people.,
And he has made one thing clear.,
"He wants to reestablish what was part of the Soviet empire, not just a peace.",
He wants all of Ukraine.,
That's what he wants.,
And then do you think he'll stop there?,
"Do you think he'll stop when he, if he takes Ukraine?",
What do you think happens to Poland?,
What do you think of Belarus?,
What do you think happens to those NATO countries?,
"And so if you want a war, you ought to find out what he's going to do, because if in fact he does what he says and walks away, by the way, all that money we give Ukraine and from weapons we make here in the United States, we give them the weapons, not the money at this point.",
And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have.,
That's why we're strong.,
" Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it.",
The first stage is treat the hostages for a ceasefire.,
Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions.,
The third phase is the end of the war.,
The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas.,
"Number one, they're the only ones standing out.",
We're still pushing hard to get them to accept.,
"In the meantime, what's happened?",
"In Israel, the only thing I've denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs.",
They don't work very well in populated areas.,
They kill a lot of innocent people.,
We're providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.,
"And by the way, I'm the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown intercontinental ballistic missile attack on Israel.",
No one was hurt.,
No one Israeli was accidentally killed.,
And it stopped.,
We saved Israel.,
We are the biggest producer of support for Israel of anyone in the world.,
And so there are two different things.,
Hamas cannot be allowed to be continued.,
We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people as to how they can get Hamas like we did bin Laden.,
You don't have to do it.,
"And by the way, they've been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened, and they should be.",
They should be eliminated.,
But you've got to be careful for using certain weapons among population centers.,
Just going back to Ukraine for one second.,
We have an ocean separating us.,
"The European nations together have spent $100 billion, or maybe more than that, less than us.",
"Why doesn't he call them, say, you've got to put up your money like I did with NATO?",
I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars.,
The secretary general of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I've ever seen.,
They wouldn't have any.,
They were going out of business.,
We were spending almost 100% of the money was paid by us.,
He didn't do that.,
He's getting all... You got to ask these people to put up the money.,
"We're over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them because of location, because we have an ocean in between.",
You got to ask them.,
"As far as Israel,  And Hamas, Israel's the one that wants to go.",
He said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas.,
"Actually, Israel is the one.",
And you should let him go and let him finish the job.,
He doesn't want to do it.,
"He's become like a Palestinian, but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian.",
He's a weak one.,
"President Biden, do you have a minute?",
I've never heard so much foolishness.,
This is a guy who wants to get out of NATO.,
Are you going to stay in NATO?,
He's going to pull out of NATO.,
The idea that we have our strength lies in our alliances as well.,
"It may be a big ocean, but are we ever able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe?",
"What happens if, in fact, you have Putin continue to go into NATO?",
We have an Article 5 agreement.,
Attack on one is attack on all.,
"You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about, go ahead, let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places.",
You see what happens then?,
He has no idea what the hell he's talking about.,
"And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace.",
No major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe.,
I'd have to see.,
"But before we do that, the problem we have is that we spend all the money.",
So they kill us on trade.,
I made great trade deals with the European nations.,
"Because if you add them up, they're about the same size economically.",
Their economy is about the same size as the United States.,
"And they were written, no cars, no, they don't want anything that we have, but we're supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.",
I changed that.,
But the big thing I change is they don't want to pay.,
And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars.,
"I said, and he's right about this, I said, no, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay.",
"They asked me that question, would you guard us against Russia at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time?",
"And I said, no, if you don't pay, I won't do that.",
And you know what happened?,
Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months.,
But now we're in the same position.,
We're paying everybody's bills.,
"Well, I don't think too many believe that.",
And let me tell you about January 6th.,
"On January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few.",
"On January 6th, we were energy independent.",
"On January 6th, we had the lowest taxes ever.",
We had the lowest regulations ever.,
"On January 6th, we were respected all over the world.",
"All over the world, we were respected.",
"And then he comes in, and we're now left at.",
We're like a bunch of stupid people.,
What happened to the United States' reputation under this man's leadership  is horrible including weaponization which i'm sure at some point you'll be talking about where he goes after his political opponent because he can't beat him fair and square,
"Well, I didn't say that to anybody.",
I said peacefully and patriotically.,
"And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watched the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who's a documentary filmmaker, like they say,  But she's saying, oh, no, it's my responsibility.",
I was responsible for this.,
"Because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down.",
"And the mayor of, in writing, by the way, the mayor, in writing, turned it down, the mayor of DC.",
They turned it down.,
"I offered $10,000 because I could see.",
I had virtually nothing to do.,
They asked me to go make a speech.,
I could see what was happening.,
Everybody was saying they're going to be there on January 6.,
They're going to be there.,
"And I said, you know what?",
There's a lot of people coming.,
You could feel it.,
"You could feel it, too.",
And you could feel it.,
"And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever.",
"And I offered it to her, and she now admits that she turned it down.",
"And it was the same day she was, I don't know, he can't be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar.",
"She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.",
" He encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one.",
I sat in the dining room off the Oval Office.,
"He sat there for three hours, three hours watching, begging, being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues in the Republican side as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it.",
"Instead, he talked  They've talked about these people being patriots and great patrons of America.",
"In fact, he says he'll not forgive them for what they've done.",
They've been convicted.,
"He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that, you know, he went to every single court in the nation.",
"I don't know how many cases, scores of cases, including the Supreme Court.",
"And they said, they said, no, no, this guy, this guy is responsible for doing what is being, what was done.",
he did do a damn thing and these people should be in jail and they should be the ones who are being held accountable and he wants to let them all out and now he says if he loses again such a whiner that he is that it could be a bloodbath thank you president biden president trump,
" What they've done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.",
"What you have done, how you've destroyed the lives of so many people.",
"When they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities, you go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they've done there with the fires all over the city.",
"If I didn't bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.",
When you look at all of the  They took over big chunks of Seattle.,
I was all set to bring in the National Guard.,
"They heard that, they saw them coming, and they left immediately.",
What he said about this whole subject is so off.,
Peacefully patriotic.,
One other thing.,
"The unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now, out of office, and Democrats, all Democrats, they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found because they found out we were right.",
We were right.,
And they deleted and destroyed all of the information.,
They should go to jail for that.,
"If a Republican did that, they'd go to jail.",
" The only person in this stage is a convicted felon, is the man I'm looking at right now.",
"And the fact of the matter is, what he's telling you is simply not true.",
The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up in Capitol Hill.,
"And all those people, every one of those who were convicted deserves to be convicted.",
"The idea that they didn't kill somebody, just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows, occupied offices, turned over desks,  turn them over statutes.",
The idea that those people are patriots?,
Come on.,
"When I asked him about the first two debates we had, the debates we had first time around, I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys?",
"He said, no, I'll tell them to stand by.",
"The idea he's refusing, will you denounce these guys?",
Will you denounce the people we're talking about now?,
Will you denounce the people who attacked that Capitol?,
What are you going to do?,
" Well, I said my retribution is going to be success.",
We're going to make this country successful again because right now it's a failing nation.,
My retribution is going to be success.,
"But when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon at a very high level.",
"His son is convicted, going to be convicted probably numerous other times.",
"He should have been convicted before, but his Justice Department let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things.",
But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office.,
Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he's done.,
He's done horrible things.,
"All of the death caused at the border, telling the Ukrainian people that we're going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor, otherwise you're not getting a billion dollars.",
Have I ever said that?,
That's quid pro quo.,
that we're not going to do anything we're not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor having to do with the sun this man is a criminal this man you're lucky you're lucky i did nothing wrong we'd have a system that was rigged and disgusting i did nothing wrong thank you president trump president biden you have said i'm coming right to you sir you well you want to respond go ahead i'll give you a minute to respond,
 the idea that i did anything wrong relative to what you're talking about is outrageous it's simply a lie number one number two the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any american just because your president is wrong is simply wrong no president's ever spoken like that before no president in our history has spoken like that before number three  the crimes that you are still charged with and think of all the civil penalties you have how many billions of dollars do you own civil penalties for for molesting a woman in public for doing a whole range of things of having sex with a porn star on the night while your wife was pregnant i mean what what are you talking about you have the morals of an alley cat,
" I didn't have sex with a porn star, number one.",
"Number two, that was a case that was started and moved.",
"They moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan DA's office to start that case.",
That case is going to be appealed and won.,
"We had a very terrible judge, a horrible judge, Democrat.",
"The prosecutor were all high-ranking Democrats, appointed people, and both the civil  and the criminal he basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me but when the public found out about these cases because they understand it better than he does he has no idea what these cases are but what he when they found out about these cases you know what they did my poll numbers went up way up you know that because you're reporting it  And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we've ever taken in in the history of any campaign.",
I don't think any campaign has ever taken hundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it's a scam.,
And it's a guy that's after his political opponent because he can't win fair and square.,
" The more they know about what he's done, yes.",
The more they know about what he's done.,
And there's a lot more coming.,
He's got a lot of cases down the road coming around.,
He's got a whole range of issues he has to face.,
"I don't know what the juries will do, but I do know he has a real problem.",
"And so the fact that, could you ever think you heard any president say that I'm going to seek retribution?",
Do you ever hear any presidents say that I thought Hitler had some good ideas?,
"What got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died, I decided in Iraq, because of Iraq, I said I wasn't going to run again until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia.",
"People coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches, torches, and singing the same anti-Semitic bio they sang back in Germany.",
And a young woman got killed.,
I spoke to the mother.,
"And they asked him, they said, what do you think of those people?",
"The people who, the ones who got killed, the one who tried to stop it, and the ones, he said, I think they're fine people on both sides.",
What American president would ever say?,
"Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same anti-Semitic bile, carrying swastikas.",
We're fine people.,
This is a guy who says Hitler's done some good things.,
I'd like to know what they are.,
"The good things Hitler's done, that's what he said.",
This guy has no sense of American democracy.,
 President Trump.,
"Jake, both of you know that story has been totally wiped out because when you see the sentence, it said 100 percent exoneration on this.",
So he just keeps it going.,
He says he ran because of Charlottesville.,
He didn't run because of Charlottesville.,
He ran because it was his last chance.,
He's not equipped to be president.,
You know it and I know it.,
It's ridiculous.,
We have a debate.,
"We're trying to justify his presidency, his presidency, his presidency.",
without question the worst president the worst presidency in the history of our country we shouldn't be having a debate about it there's nothing to debate he made up the charlottesville story and you'll see it's debunked all over the place every anchor has every reasonable actor has debunked it and just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked it's a nonsense story he knows that and he didn't run because of charlottesville he used that as an excuse to run,
And debunk.,
It happened.,
All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time.,
And the idea that somehow that's the only reason I ran.,
I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy could get elected.,
"If he thought they were good people coming out of that forest, carrying those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn't deserve to be president.",
Didn't deserve to be president at all.,
And the idea...  that he's talking about all this being fabricated we saw their own eyes we saw what happened on january 6 we saw the people breaking through the windows we saw people occupying their his own vice president look there's a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused to endorse him this time his vice president hasn't endorsed him this time so why why they know him well they serve with him why are they not endorsing him thank you president biden we're going to be right back with more from the cnn presidential debate,
" They acknowledge they made a lot of progress, number one.",
The fact of the matter is there's more small black businesses that have been started than any time in history.,
"Number two, the wages of black, black unemployment is the lowest level it's been in a long, long time.",
"Number three, we find them providing housing for black Americans and dealing with the segregation that exists among these corporate, these corporate rations that collude to keep people out of their houses.",
"And in addition to that, we find that the impact on the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult.",
"When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs.",
"I cut them in half, in half.",
We gotta make sure we provide for childcare costs.,
"We gotta make sure, because when you provide those childcare protections,  you increase economic growth because more people can be in the job market.",
"So there's more to be done, considerably more to be done.",
But we've done a great deal so far and I'm not letting up and they know it.,
 I say I don't blame them for being disappointed.,
Inflation is still hurting them badly.,
"For example, I provided for the idea that any black family first-time homebuyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started.",
"I made sure that we're in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning  that if they were engaged in nursing, anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years under student debt, all the rest is forgiven after 10 years.",
Millions have benefited from that.,
And we're going to do a whole lot more for Black families.,
"Thank you, President Trump.",
And he caused the inflation.,
He's blaming inflation.,
And he's right.,
It's been very bad.,
He caused the inflation and it's killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody.,
It's killing people.,
They can't buy groceries anymore.,
They can't.,
You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled.,
They can't live.,
They're not living anymore.,
He caused this inflation.,
I gave him a country with no essentially no inflation.,
It was perfect.,
It was so good.,
All he had to do is leave it alone.,
He destroyed it with his Green News scam and all of the other all this money that's being thrown out the window.,
He caused inflation.,
"As sure as you're sitting there, the fact is that his big kill.",
on the black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border they're taking black jobs now and it could be 18 it could be 19 and even 20 million people they're taking black jobs and they're taking hispanic jobs and you haven't seen it yet but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history thank you president biden,
 There was no inflation when I became president.,
You know why?,
The economy was flat on its back.,
Fifteen percent unemployment.,
"He decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy.",
That's why there was no inflation at the time.,
There were no jobs.,
"We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were in rural communities, including minority communities.",
We made sure that they have health insurance.,
We have covered with the ACA has increased.,
"I made sure that they're $8,000 per person in the family to get written off for the health care.",
But this guy wants to eliminate that.,
They tried 50 times.,
He wants to get rid of the ACA again.,
And they're going to try again if they win.,
You find ourselves in a position where the idea that we're not doing it.,
I put more.,
We put more police on the street than any administration has.,
He wants to cut the cops.,
"We're providing for equity, equity and making sure people have a shot to make it.",
There's a lot going on.,
"But in inflation, he caused it by his tremendous malfeasance in the way he handled the pandemic.",
" Let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him.",
Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump.,
Almost every police group.,
"And what he's done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators.",
"We can't, in the 1990s, we can't forget that.",
"Super predators was his name, and he called it to them for 10, and they've taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening.",
"But when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities where I funded them and got them all funded, and the Opportunity Zones with Tim, as you know, Tim Scott was incredible.",
"He did a great job, great senator from South Carolina.",
"He came to me with the idea, and it was a great idea.",
"It's one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, Opportunity Zones.",
And the biggest beneficiary are blacks.,
And that's why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever.,
They're saying ever.,
I read this morning we're ever the best numbers.,
He's lost much of the black population because he's done a horrible job for black people.,
He's also done a horrible job for Hispanics.,
But wait till you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they're going to take the jobs.,
And it's already started.,
And you haven't seen anything yet.,
It's a disaster.,
So I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air.,
And we had it.,
We had H2O.,
We had the best numbers ever.,
And we did.,
"We were using  all forms of energy, all forms, everything.",
"And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever.",
"And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually.",
 I don't know where the hell he's been.,
The idea that he said is true.,
"I passed the most extensive climate change legislation in history, in history.",
"We find ourselves, and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don't have  They don't have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like.",
Any black student is capable in college of doing what any white student can do.,
"They just have the money, but now they'll be able to get those jobs in high tech.",
"We're in a situation where the idea that he is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water,  cleanest water he hadn't done a damn thing in the environment he out of the paris peace accord common accord i immediately joined it because if we reach 1.5 degrees celsius at any one point where there's no way back the only existential threat to humanity is climate change and he didn't do a damn thing about it he must undo all that i've done",
 The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars and China nothing and Russia nothing and India nothing.,
It was a rip off of the United States.,
And I ended it because I didn't want to waste that money because they treat us horribly.,
We were the only ones who was costing us money.,
Nobody else was paying into it.,
And it was it was a disaster.,
"But everything that he said just now, I'll give you an example.",
I heard him say before insulin.,
I'm the one that got the insulin down for the seniors.,
I took care of the seniors.,
"What he's doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in, they want everybody.",
"And look, I have the biggest heart on the stage.",
I guarantee you that.,
And I want to take care of people.,
But we're destroying our country.,
"They're taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they're going to be taking over Social Security.",
"He is destroying Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.",
" The idea is that we, in fact, we were the only ones of consequence.",
We're not.,
We're not members of the Paris Accord.,
How can we do anything?,
We're not able.,
The United States can't get us.,
"under control, one of the largest polluters in the world, number one.",
We're making significant progress.,
"By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half.",
"We have made significant progress, and we're continuing to make progress.",
"We set up a climate corps for thousands of young people to learn how to deal with, just like the Peace Corps.",
And we're moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of cause of pollution.,
"But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he's really concerned about pollution and about climate, I've not seen any indication of that.",
"And by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for one voluntarily.",
"I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company cannot have to pay.",
Thank you.,
" Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share.",
"Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6% of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck from the time of the first one they get when they're 18 years old.",
"The idea that they're going to, I'm not proposing that everybody, they pay...",
"The millionaires pay 1%, 1%.",
"So no one after, I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000.",
"After that, I began to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share by increasing from 1% beyond to be able to guarantee the program for life.",
"Well, that one enough will keep it solvent.",
"But the biggest thing I'll do if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security.",
He thinks there's plenty to cut in Social Security.,
He's wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare.,
both times.,
"And if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican caucus that he supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well.",
The idea that we don't need to protect our seniors is ridiculous.,
"And by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before.",
"And on the ACA, as I said, you're in a circumstance where 400,000 people, I mean 40 million people would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition.",
Only allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA.,
"And by the way, the other thing is we're in a situation where I talk about education for  black communities.",
"I've raised the number, the amount of money for Pell Grants by another $8,000.",
"Anybody making under $70,000 a year is going to be able to get $15,000 toward their tuition.",
He just doesn't know what he's talking about.,
 So I've dealt with politicians all my life.,
I've been on this side of the equation for the last eight years.,
I've never seen anybody lie like this guy.,
He lies.,
I've never seen if he could look you in the face.,
"So about so many other things, too.",
And we mentioned the laptop.,
"We mentioned Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.",
Everything he does is a lie.,
It's misinformation and disinformation.,
The losers and suckers story that he made up is a total lie on the military.,
It's a disgrace.,
But Social Security.,
"He's destroying it because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they're putting them onto Social Security.",
"They're putting them onto Medicare, Medicaid.",
They're putting them in our hospitals.,
They're taking the place of our citizens.,
"What they're doing to the VA, to our veterans, is unbelievable.",
"Our veterans are living in the street, and these people are living in luxury hotels.",
"He doesn't know what he's doing, and it's really coming back.",
I've never seen such anger in our country before.,
President Biden?,
" The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before.",
"And by the way, when I said suckers and losers, he said he acknowledged after that he fired that general.",
That general got fired because he's the one that acknowledged that that's what he said.,
"He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one.",
"Number two, the idea that we're going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs.",
"There's a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, the reason why we have the most successful economy in the world.",
We're doing better than any other nation in the world.,
"And by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates he talked about being phony, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that if Trump is reelected, we're likely to have a recession.",
and and inflation is going to increasingly go up and by the way worst president history 159 presidential scholars voted in him the worst president in the history of united states of america,
" Just to go back, the general got fired because he was no good.",
"And if he said that, that's why he made it up.",
"But we have 19 people that said I didn't say it, and they're very highly respected, much more so than him.",
"The other thing is, he doesn't fire people.",
He never fired people.,
I've never seen him fire anybody.,
I did fire a lot.,
I fired Comey because he was no good.,
"I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp.",
They were no good.,
Not easy to fire people.,
"You'd pay a price for it, but they were no good.",
I inherited these people.,
I didn't put Comey there.,
He was no good.,
I fired him.,
This guy hasn't fired anybody.,
He never fires.,
"He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan, the Afghanistan horror show, the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.",
He didn't fire.,
Did you fire anybody?,
Did you fire anybody that's on the border that's allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world?,
"Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions?",
Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed?,
"Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate.",
This shouldn't be a debate.,
He is the worst president.,
He just said it about me because I said it.,
"But look, he's the worst president in the history of our country.",
He's destroyed our country.,
Now all of a sudden he's trying to get a little tough on the border.,
"He came out with a...  nothing, a nothing deal.",
"And it reduced it a little bit, a little bit like this much.",
It's insignificant.,
He wants open borders.,
He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters.,
And I don't think we just can't let it happen.,
"If he wins this election, our country doesn't have a chance, not even a chance.",
"of coming out of this rut, we probably won't have a country left anymore.",
That's how bad it is.,
He is the worst in history by far.,
We are the most admired country in the world.,
We're the United States of America.,
There's nothing beyond our capacity.,
We have the finest military in the history of the world.,
The finest in the history of the world.,
No one thinks we're weak.,
No one wants to screw around with us.,
Nobody.,
Number one.,
"Number two, the idea that we're talking about worse presidents.",
I wasn't joking.,
Look it up or go online.,
"159 or 58, don't hold me to the exact number, presidential historians, they've had meetings and they voted who was the worst president in American history, one through best to worst.",
They said he was the worst in all of American history.,
That's a fact.,
That's not conjecture.,
"He can argue they're wrong, but that's what they voted.",
"The idea that he is doing anything to deal with childcare,  He did very virtually nothing to child care.",
We should significantly increase the child care tax credit.,
We should significantly increase the availability of women and men or single parents to be able to go back to work.,
"And we should encourage businesses to hold, to have.",
Just so you understand.,
We have polling.,
We have other things that they rate him the worst because what he's done is so bad.,
And they rate me.,
I'll show you.,
I will show you.,
And they rate me one of the best.,
"OK. And if I'm given another four years, I will be the best.",
I think I'll be the best.,
Nobody's ever.,
created an economy like us.,
Nobody ever cut taxes like us.,
He's the only one I know.,
He wants to raise your taxes by four times.,
He wants to raise everybody's taxes by four times.,
"He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody, including the two of you, are going to pay four to five times.",
Nobody ever heard of this before.,
All my life I'd grow up and I'd see politicians talking about cutting taxes.,
"When we cut taxes, as I said, we did more business.",
"Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country.",
 the worst president in history by far and everybody knows it president biden look the fact of the matter is that he's dead wrong about he's increased the terror he's increased he will increase the uh taxes on middle class people i said i'd never raised the tax upon anybody i'm making less than four hundred thousand dollars i didn't but this tariff is ten percent tariffs everything coming into the country you know what the economists say that's going to cost the average american the  two thousand five hundred dollars a year more because they're gonna have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important number two he's in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised he's he's somehow helped the middle class  The middle class has been devastated by you.,
"Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next 10 years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country.",
"You have the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one.",
"Number two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China.",
We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010.,
"Thank you, President Biden.",
To finish up?,
We now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy.,
We have the largest deficit with China.,
He gets paid by China.,
He's a Manchurian candidate.,
He gets money from China.,
So I think he's afraid to deal with it or something.,
But do you notice he never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China.,
He never took them away.,
He can't because it's too much money.,
It's tremendous.,
"And we saved our steel industries, and there was more to come.",
But he hasn't done that.,
"But he hasn't cut the tariffs because he can't, because it's too much money.",
"But he's got the largest deficit in the history of our country, and he's got the worst situation with China.",
China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they're doing to us as a country.,
"They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can't let that happen.",
You're destroying our country.,
"Jake, we were doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along.",
"We had the two and a half, almost three years like nobody's ever had before, any country, in every way.",
And then we had to get tough.,
"And the drugs pouring across the border, it started to increase.",
We got great equipment.,
"We bought the certain dog that's the most incredible thing that you've ever seen, the way they can spot it.",
We did a lot.,
"And we were getting very low numbers, very, very low numbers.",
Then he came along.,
"The numbers, have you seen the numbers now?",
"It's not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because the gotaways, they don't even talk about gotaways.",
"But the numbers of the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border, the worst thing I've ever seen at numbers that nobody's ever seen under him because the border is so bad.",
But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we've ever had by far.,
Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while.,
"And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border.",
And it costs a lot of money.,
"That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal.",
"More fentanyl machines, more to be able to detect drugs, more numbers of  of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border.",
"And when we had that deal done, he called his Republican colleagues and said, don't do it.",
It's going to hurt me politically.,
He never argued it's not a good bill.,
It's a really good bill.,
We need those machines.,
We need those machines.,0.0
And we're coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl.,
And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don't have the technology to be able to put it together.,
That's what we have to do.,
We need those machines.,0.0
 Because this does pertain to it.,
He ended Remain in Mexico.,
He ended Catch and Release.,
"I made it Catch and Release in Mexico, not Catch and Release here.",
"We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing.",
It's just like when you have a hostage.,
We always pay $6 billion for every time there's a hostage.,
"Now we have a hostage, a Wall Street Journal reporter.",
I think a good guy.,
"And he's over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter.",
I will have him out very quickly as soon as I take office.,
"Before I take office, I said by literally as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out.",
He should have had him out a long time ago.,
But Putin's probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time.,
We had two cases.,
We paid $6 billion for five people.,
"I got 58 people out, and I paid essentially nothing.",
" Well, first of all, I spent half my career being criticized, being the youngest person in politics.",
"I was the second youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate, and now I'm the oldest.",
This guy's three years younger and a lot less competent.,
I think that just look at the record.,
Look at what I've done.,
Look how I've turned around the horrible situation he left me.,
"As I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America.",
over billions of dollars in private investment in enterprises that we are growing.,
"By the way, we brought an awful lot of people, the whole idea of computer chips.",
We used to have 40% of the market.,
We invented those chips and we lost it because he was sending people to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product.,
So I went to South Korea.,
I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States.,
And guess what?,
"Those fabs they call to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000.",
You don't need a college degree for them.,
"And there's billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States creating significant jobs for Americans from all over the world.",
"Yeah, I would.",
The idea that somehow we are this failing country.,
I never heard a president talk like this before.,
We're the envy of the world.,
Name me a single major country president who wouldn't trade places with the United States of America for all our problems and all our opportunities.,
We're the most progressive country in the world in getting things done.,
We're the strongest country in the world.,
"We're a country in the world who keeps our word, and everybody trusts us, all of our allies, and those who he coddles up to from Kim Jong-un, who he sends love letters to, and Putin, et cetera.",
They don't want to screw around with us.,
"Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests.",
"I aced them, both of them, as you know.",
We made it public.,
He took none.,
"I'd like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one.",
"Like, go through the first five questions.",
He couldn't do it.,
But I took two cognitive tests.,
I took physical exams every year.,
"And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I'm in very good health.",
"I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships.",
"To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way.",
And I do it.,
He doesn't do it.,
He can't hit a ball 50 yards.,
He challenged me to a golf match.,
He can't hit a ball 50 yards.,0.0
I think I'm in very good shape.,
"I feel that I'm as in good shape as I was 25, 30 years ago.",
"Actually, I'm probably a little bit lighter.",
But I'm in as good a shape as I was years ago.,
I feel very good.,
I feel the same.,
But I took I was willing to take a cognitive test.,
And you know what?,
"If I didn't do well, I aced him.",
"Dr. Ronny Jackson, who's a great guy when he was White House doctor.",
"And then I took another one, a similar one.",
And both one of them said they've never seen anybody ace him.,
 You can see he is 6'5 and only 235 pounds.,
"Well, you said 6'4, 200.",
"Well, anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is.",
"Look, I'd be happy to have a driving contest with him.",
"The reason I got my handicap, which when I was vice president, down to a six.",
"And by the way, I told you before, I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag.",
Think you can do it?,
That's the biggest lie.,
He's a six handicap of all.,
I was eight handicap.,
Yeah.,
Eight.,
I've seen you swing.,
I know you swing.,
Let's not act like children.,
"President Trump, we're going to turn.",
Let's not act like children.,0.0
" Well, I shouldn't have to say that, but of course I believe that.",
It's totally unacceptable.,
"And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it's one of the strongest statements you've ever seen.",
"In addition to the speech I made in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I've ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that.",
They talk about  a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol and in many cases were ushered in by the police.,
"And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine.",
She said that loud and clear.,
"But the answer is, if the election is fair, free, and I want that more than anybody.",
And I'll tell you something.,
i wish he was a great president because i wouldn't be here right now i'd be at one of my many places enjoying myself i wouldn't be under indictment because i wouldn't have been his political appoint you know opponent because he indicted me because i was his opponent i wish he was a great president i would rather have that i wouldn't be here i don't mind being here but the only reason i'm here is he's so bad as a president  that I'm going to make America great again.,
We're going to make America great again.,
We're a failing nation right now.,
We're a seriously failing nation.,
And we're a failing nation because of him.,
His policies are so bad.,
His military policies are insane.,
They're insane.,
These are wars that will never end with him.,
He will drive us into World War III.,
And we're closer to World War III than anybody can imagine.,
"We are very, very close to World War III, and he's driving us there.",
"And Kim Jong-un and President Xi of China, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, all of these, Putin, they don't respect him.",
They don't fear him.,
"They have nothing going with this gentleman, and he's going to drive us into World War III.",
" You want a World War III, let him follow and win and let Putin say, do what you want, NATO.",
Just do what you want.,
"There's a thing called Article V, an attack on one is an attack on all, a required response.",
"The idea, the idea, I can't think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn't trade places with the job I've done and what they've done.",
because we are a powerful nation we have wonderful peace because of the people not me it's because of the american people they're capable of anything and they step up when they're needed and right now we're needed we're needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake and again you want to have a war just let putin go ahead and take kiev make sure they move on see what happens in poland hungary and other places along that border then you have a war,
"Just to finish what he said, if I might.",
"Russia, they took a lot of land from Bush.",
They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden.,
"They took no land, nothing from Trump, nothing.",
He knew not to do it.,
He's not going to play games with me.,
He knew that.,
"I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games.",
He took nothing from me.,
But now he's going to take the whole thing from this man right here.,
That's a war that should have never started.,
It would have never started ever with me.,
And he's going to take Ukraine.,
"And, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this?",
He's got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia.,
Because Ukraine's not winning that war.,
"He said, I will never settle until such time.",
They're running out of people.,
They're running out of soldiers.,
They've lost so many people.,
It's so sad.,
"They've lost so many people, and they've lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000 years old, all because of him and stupid decisions.",
Russia would have never attacked if I were president.,
 if it's a fair and legal and good election absolutely i would have much rather accepted these but the the fraud and everything else was ridiculous and if you want we'll have a news conference on it in a week or we'll have another one of these on in a week but i will absolutely there's nothing i'd rather do it would be much easier for me to do that  then I'm running again.,
I wasn't really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did.,
He's destroying our country.,
I would be very happy to be someplace else in a nice location someplace.,
"And again, no indictments, no political opponent stuff, because it's the only way he thinks he can win.",
"But unfortunately, it's driven up by numbers and driven up to a very high level because the people understand it.",
 Let's see what your numbers are when this election is over.,
Let's see.,
You're a whiner.,
"When you lost the first time, you continued, you appealed and appealed to courts all across the country.",
"Not one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit, state or local, none.",
But you continue to provoke...  this lie about somehow there's all this misrepresentation all this stealing there is no evidence of that at all and i tell you what i doubt whether you'll accept it because you're such a whiner the idea if you lose again you accepted anything you can't stand the loss something snapped in you and you lost the last time we'll be right back with more from the cnn presidential debate live from georgia,
We've made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his last term.,
"We find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system.",
"I ask anyone out there in the audience, or anyone out watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair?",
"The fact is that, I said, nobody making under $400,000 had a single penny  increasing their taxes and will not.",
"And if I'm reelected, that will be the case again.",
"But this guy has increased your taxes because of the deficit, number one.",
He's increased inflation because of the debacle he left after the way he handled the pandemic.,
And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10% tariff on everything that comes into the United States of America.,
"What I did, for example, he wants to get rid of the ability of Medicare for the ability for us to be able to negotiate drug prices with the big pharma companies.",
"Well, guess what?",
We got it.,
"We got it down to $35 for insulin instead of $400, no more than $2,000 for every senior, no matter how much prescription they need.",
You know what that did?,
That reduced the federal debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn't have to pay the exorbitant prices.,
I'm going to make that available to every senior.,
"all along, and it's happening now, and everybody in America.",
He wants to get rid of that.,
I'm going to make sure that we have child care.,
We're going to significantly increase the credits people have for child care.,
I'm going to make sure we do something about what we're doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country.,
We're going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break.,
" like so many politicians this man is just a complainer he said we want to do this we want to do that we want to get rid of this tax that tax but he doesn't do anything he doesn't do all he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in our military doesn't respect him we look like fools in afghanistan uh we didn't stop israel it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened it should have never happened iran was broke  Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn't do business with the United States.",
They all passed.,
Iran was broke.,
"They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah for terror, no money whatsoever.",
"Again, Ukraine should have never happened.",
"He talks about all this stuff, but he didn't do it.",
"For three and a half years, we're living in hell.",
We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place.,
You talk about Charlottesville.,
"This is a hundred times Charlottesville, a thousand times.",
"The whole country is exploding because of you, because they don't respect you and they have to respect their president and they don't respect you throughout the world.",
"what we did was incredible we rebuilt the military we got the largest tax cut in history the largest regulation cut in history the reason he's got jobs is because i cut the regulations that gave jobs but he's putting a lot of those regulations back on all of the things that we've done nobody's ever never seen anything like even from a medical standpoint right to try where we can try space age materials instead of going to asia  or going to europe and trying to get when you're terminally ill now you can go and you can get something you sign a document they've been trying to get it for 42 years but you know what we did for the military was incredible choice for our soldiers where our soldiers instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up and take care of themselves and they're living and that's why i had the highest approval rating in the history of the va  So all of these things, we're in a failing nation, but it's not going to be failing anymore.",
We're going to make it great again.,
"Together, we will chart a new way forward.",
We will soon be a great nation again.,
"Kamala Harris, what's up?",
Good to see you.,
Have fun.,
Thank you.,
" So I was raised as a middle class kid, and I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America.",
"I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people.",
And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.,
Because here's the thing.,
We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing.,
And the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people.,
"We know that young families need support to raise their children, and I intend on extending a tax cut for those families of $6,000, which is the largest child tax credit that we have given in a long time, so that those young families can afford to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children.",
"My passion, one of them is small businesses.",
"I was actually my mother raised my sister and me, but there was a woman who helped raise us.",
We call her our second mother.,
She was a small business owner.,
I love our small businesses.,
"My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction  to start up small businesses, knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy.",
"My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5 trillion to America's deficit.",
"My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20 percent tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month.",
"Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result for middle class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.",
"First of all, I have no sales tax.",
That's an incorrect statement.,
She knows that.,
We're doing tariffs on other countries.,
"Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world.",
And the tariff will be substantial in some cases.,
"They're taking billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China.",
"In fact, they never took the tariff off because there was so much money they can't.",
It would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do.,
They're taking in billions of dollars from China and other places they've left the tariffs on.,
"When I had it, I had tariffs, and yet I had no inflation.",
"Look, we've had a terrible economy because inflation has, which is really known as a country buster.",
It breaks up countries.,
We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before.,
Probably the worst in our nation's history.,
"We were at 21%, but that's being generous because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago.",
"This has been a disaster for people, for the middle class, but for every class.",
"On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums, and they're coming in and they're taking  jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics, and also unions.",
Unions are going to be affected very soon.,
And you see what's happening.,
You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States.,
"You look at Springfield, Ohio.",
You look at Aurora in Colorado.,
They are taking over the towns.,
They're taking over buildings.,
They're going in violently.,
"These are the people that she and Biden led into our country, and they're destroying our country.",
They're dangerous.,
"They're at the highest level of criminality, and we have to get them out.",
We have to get them out fast.,
I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country.,
I'll do it again and even better.,
" Well, I would love to.",
Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us.,
Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.,
Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century.,
Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.,
And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess.,
What we have done and what I intend to do is build on what we know are the aspirations and the hopes of the American people.,
"But I'm going to tell you all in this debate tonight, you're going to hear from the same old tired playbook.",
"A bunch of lies, grievances, and name-calling.",
What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again.,
"I believe very strongly that the American people want a president who understands the importance of bringing us together, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us.",
And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.,
" Number one, I have nothing to do, as you know, and as she knows better than anyone, I have nothing to do with Project 2025.",
That's out there.,
I haven't read it.,
I don't want to read it purposely.,
I'm not going to read it.,
This was a group of people that got together.,
"They came up with some ideas, I guess some good, some bad, but it makes no difference.",
I have nothing to do.,
Everybody knows I'm an open book.,
Everybody knows what I'm going to do.,
Cut taxes very substantially and create a great economy like I did before.,
We had the greatest economy.,
We got hit with a pandemic.,
"And the pandemic was not since 1917, where 100 million people died, has there been anything like it.",
We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic.,
We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in.,
Nobody has ever seen anything like it.,
We made ventilators for the entire world.,
We got gowns.,
We got masks.,
We did things that nobody thought possible.,
And people give me credit for rebuilding the military.,
"They give me credit for a lot of things, but not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic.",
But the only jobs they got were bounce back jobs.,
These were jobs bounce back and it bounced back and it went to their benefit.,
But I was the one that created them.,
They know it.,
And so does everybody else.,
"Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.",
 Donald Trump has no plan for you.,
"And when you look at his economic plan, it's all about tax breaks for the richest people.",
"I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy, and the best economists in our country, if not the world, have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America.",
"What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse, mine would strengthen the economy.",
What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan would actually explode the deficit.,
Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and by the middle of next year would invite a recession.,
You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues.,
And I'd invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.,
That's just a sound bite.,
They gave her that to say.,
"I went to the Wharton School of Finance, and many of those professors, the top professors, think my plan is a brilliant plan.",
It's a great plan.,
"It's a plan that's going to bring up our worth, our value as a country.",
"It's going to make people want to be able to go and work and create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money for our country.",
"And just to finish off,  She doesn't have a plan.",
"She copied Biden's plan, and it's like four sentences, like run, spot, run.",
"Four sentences that are just, oh, we'll try and lower taxes.",
She doesn't have a plan.,
Take a look at her plan.,
She doesn't have a plan.,0.0
They're not going to have higher prices.,
What's going to have and who's going to have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years.,
"I charge – I was the only president ever –  China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars, and so were other countries.",
"And, you know, if she doesn't like them, they should have gone out and they should have immediately cut the tariffs.",
But those tariffs are there three and a half years now under their administration.,
"We are going to take in  Billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars.",
"I had no inflation, virtually no inflation.",
They had the highest inflation perhaps in the history of our country because I've never seen a worse period of time.,
People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else.,
These the people of our country are absolutely dying with what they've done.,
They've destroyed the economy.,
And all you have to do is look at a poll.,
"The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90 percent that the Trump economy was great, that their economy was terrible.",
" Well, let's be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we've ever seen in the history of America.",
He invited trade wars.,
"You want to talk about his deal with China, what he ended up doing is under Donald Trump's presidency, he ended up selling  American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military basically sold us out when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century.",
"which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies, focusing on investing in American-based technology so that we win the race on AI, on quantum computing, focusing on what we need to do to support America's workforce so that we don't end up having on the short end of the stick  in terms of workers' rights.",
"But what Donald Trump did, let's talk about this, with COVID, is he actually thanked President Xi for what he did during COVID.",
Look at his tweet.,
"Thank you, President Xi!",
When we know that Xi was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of COVID.,
"First of all, they bought their chips from Taiwan.",
We hardly make chips anymore because of philosophies like they have and policies like they have.,
I don't say her because she has no policy.,
Everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window.,
She's going to my philosophy now.,
"In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat.",
She's gone to my philosophy.,
"If she ever got elected, she'd change it, and it will be the end of our country.",
She's a Marxist.,
Everybody knows she's a Marxist.,
"Her father's a Marxist professor in economics, and he taught her well.",
"But when you look at what she's done to our country, and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly  where it's, I believe, 21 million people, not the 15 that people say.",
And I think it's a lot higher than the 21.,
That's bigger than New York State pouring in.,
And just look at what they're doing to our country.,
They're criminals.,
Many of these people coming in are criminals.,
"And that's bad for our economy, too.",
"You know, you mentioned before, we'll talk about immigration later.",
"Well, bad immigration is the worst thing that can happen to our economy.",
"They have, and she has, destroyed our country with policy that's insane.",
Almost policy that you'd say they have to hate our country.,
"President Trump, thank you.",
Lindsay?,
" The reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month.",
"They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, is doing an excellent job.",
"But the governor before, he said, the baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby.",
"In other words, we'll execute the baby.",
"And that's why I did that, because that predominates.",
Because they're radical.,
The Democrats are radical in that.,
"And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way, for our country, because he is really out of it.",
"But her vice presidential pick says, abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine.",
He also says...,
Execution after birth.,
"It's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born is okay.",
"And that's not okay with me, hence the vote.",
But what I did is something for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states.,
"And through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices, we were able to do that.",
"Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.",
I believe strongly in it.,
Ronald Reagan did also.,
85% of Republicans do.,
Exceptions.,
Very important.,
"But we were able to get it, and now states are voting on it.",
"And for the first time, you're going to see, look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years.",
"Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote.",
And that's what happened.,
"Now, Ohio?",
The vote was somewhat liberal.,
"Kansas, the vote was somewhat liberal, much more liberal than people would have thought.",
But each individual state is voting.,
It's the vote of the people now.,
It's not tied up in the federal government.,
I did a great service in doing it.,
It took courage to do it.,
And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it.,
And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.,
" Well, as I said, you're going to hear a bunch of lies and that's not actually a surprising fact.",
Let's understand how we got here.,
Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade.,
And they did exactly as he intended.,
"And now in over 20 states, there are Trump abortion bans, which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care.",
"In one state, it provides prison for life.",
"Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest, which understand what that means.",
"A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next.",
That is immoral.,
And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree.,
The government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.,
I have talked with women around our country.,
You want to talk about this is what people wanted?,
Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot.,
She didn't want that.,
Her husband didn't want that.,
A 12 or 13 year old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term.,
They don't want that.,
"And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.",
"But understand, if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban.",
"Understand, in his Project 2025, there would be a national abortion monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages.",
"that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make decisions about one's own body, should not be made by the government.",
"Well, there she goes again.",
It's a lie.,
"I'm not signing a ban, and there's no reason to sign a ban, because we've gotten what everybody wanted.",
"Democrats, Republicans, and everybody else, and every legal scholar wanted it to be brought back into the states, and the states are voting.",
"And it may take a little time,  But for 52 years, this issue has torn our country apart.",
And they've wanted it back in the states.,
And I did something that nobody thought was possible.,
The states are now voting.,
What she says is an absolute lie.,
"And as far as the abortion ban,  No, I'm not in favor of abortion bans, but it doesn't matter because this issue has now been taken over by the states.",
"Well, I won't have to because, again, two things.",
"Number one, she said she'll go back to Congress.",
She'll never get the vote.,
"It's impossible for her to get the vote, especially now with the 50-50, essentially 50-50 in both Senate and the House.",
She's not going to get the vote.,
She can't get the vote.,
She won't even come close to it.,
So it's just talk.,
You know what it reminds me of?,
"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated, and it ended up being a total catastrophe.",
"The student loans, and then her, I think probably her boss, if you call him a boss, he spends all his time on the beach.",
"But look, her boss went out and said, we'll do it again.",
We'll do it a different way.,
"And he went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court.",
So all these students got...  taunted with this whole thing about this whole idea and how unfair that would have been part of the reason they lost to the millions and millions of people that had to pay off their student loans they didn't get it for free but they were saying it's the same way that they talked about that that they talk about abortion,
"Well, I didn't discuss it with J.D.",
"In all fairness, J.D.",
"And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I think he was speaking for me, but I really didn't.",
Look.,
We don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it.,
"Just like she couldn't get student loans, they couldn't get student loans.",
They didn't even come close to getting student loans.,
They taunted young people and a lot of other people that had loans.,
They can never get this approved.,
So it doesn't matter what she says about going to Congress.,
"Wonderful, let's go to Congress, do it.",
But the fact is that for years they wanted to get it out of Congress and out of the federal government.,
And we did something that everybody said couldn't be done.,
And now you have a vote of the people on abortion.,
I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade.,
"And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America  is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion.",
That is not happening.,
It's insulting to the women of America.,
And understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans.,
Couples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments.,
What is happening in our country?,
"Working people, working women who are working one or two jobs, who can barely afford childcare as it is, have to travel to another state to get on a plane sitting next to strangers to go and get the healthcare she needs.",
barely can afford to do it and what you are putting her through is unconscionable.,
"And the people of America have not, the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot in red and blue states both, the people of America have voted for freedom.",
" Vice President Harris, thank you.",
"Vice President Harris Jr. : Excuse me, I have to respond.",
Another lie.,
It's another lie.,
"I have been a leader on IVF, which is fertilization.",
"The IVF, I have been a leader.",
"In fact, when they got a very negative decision on IVF from the Alabama courts,  I saw the people of Alabama and the legislature two days later voted it in.",
I've been a leader on it.,
"They know that, and everybody else knows it.",
I have been a leader on fertilization IVF.,
"And the other thing, they, you should ask, will she allow abortion in the eighth month, ninth month, seventh month?",
Come on.,
"Okay, would you do that?",
Why don't you ask her that question?,
That's the problem.,
"Because under Roe v. Wade, you could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month, and probably after birth.",
"Just look at the governor, former governor of Virginia.",
The governor of Virginia said we put the baby aside and then we determine what we want to do with the baby.,
"So I'm the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings.",
"And let me say that the United States Congress, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, came up with a border security bill which I supported.",
"And that bill would have put 1,500 more border agents on the border to help those folks who are working there right now over time trying to do their job.",
It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.,
I know there are so many families watching tonight who have been personally affected by the surge of fentanyl in our country.,
"That bill would have put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns, drugs, and human beings.",
But you know what happened to that bill?,
"Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said kill the bill.",
And you know why?,
Because he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.,
"And understand, this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in solutions, who actually addresses the problems at hand.",
But what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.,
"And I'll tell you something, he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight, even when it's not the subject that is being raised.",
"And I'm going to actually do something really unusual, and I'm going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies, because it's a really interesting thing to watch.",
"You will see during the course of his rallies, he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter,  He will talk about windmills cause cancer.",
And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom.,
"And I will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you.",
"You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your desires.",
"And I'll tell you, I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first.",
And I pledge to you that I will.,
"Well, I would like to respond.",
"First, let me respond to the rallies.",
She said people start leaving.,
People don't go to her rallies.,
There's no reason to go.,
"And the people that do go, she's busing them in and paying them to be there, and then showing them in a different light.",
So she can't talk about that.,
People don't leave my rallies.,
"We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.",
That's because people want to take their country back.,
Our country is being lost.,
We're a failing nation.,
And it happened three and a half years ago.,
"And what's going on here, you're going to end up in World War III, just to go into another subject.",
What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country and look at what's happening to the towns all over the United States.,
And a lot of towns don't want to talk.,
It's not going to be Aurora or Springfield.,
A lot of towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it.,
"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in.",
They're eating the cats.,
They're eating...,
They're eating the pets of the people that live there.,
"And this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame.",
"As far as rallies are concerned, as far as the reason they go is they like what I say.",
They want to bring our country back.,
They want to make America great again.,
"It's a very simple phrase, make America great again.",
 The people on television say my dog was taken and used for food.,
"So maybe he said that, and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager.",
But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.,
 You talk about extreme.,
"This is, I think, one of the reasons why, in this election, I actually have the endorsement of 200 Republicans who have formally worked with President Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain, including the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congress member Liz Cheney.",
"And if you want to really know the inside track on who the former president is, if he didn't make it clear already, just ask people who have worked with him.",
"His former chief of staff, a four-star general, has said he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States.",
His former national security advisor has said he is dangerous and unfit.,
"His former secretary of defense has said the nation, the republic, would never survive another Trump term.",
"And when we listen to this kind of rhetoric, when the issues that affect the American people are not being addressed, I think the choice is clear in this election.",
"PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, Thank you, because when I hear that, see, I'm a different kind of a person.",
"I fired most of those people, not so graciously.",
They did bad things or a bad job.,
I fired them.,
They never fired one person.,
"They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people who were just killed, viciously and violently killed.",
And I got to know the parents and the family.,
They didn't fire.,
"They should have fired all those generals, all those top people, because that was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen.",
"So when somebody does a bad job, I fire them.",
And you take a guy like Esper.,
He was no good.,
I fired him.,
So he writes a book.,
Another one writes a book.,
"Because with me, they can write books.",
With nobody else can they.,
"But they have done such a poor job, and they never fire anybody.",
Look at the economy.,
Look at the inflation.,
They didn't fire any of their economists.,
They have the same people.,
That's a good way not to have books written about you.,
"But just to finish, I got more votes than any Republican in history by far.",
"In fact, I got more votes than any president, sitting president, in history by far.",
military.,
With local police.,
 It is much higher because of them.,
"They allowed criminals, many, many millions of criminals.",
They allowed terrorists.,
They allowed common street criminals.,
"They allowed people to come in, drug dealers, to come into our country.",
"And they're now in the United States and told by their countries, like Venezuela, don't ever come back or we're going to kill you.",
Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down  You know why?,
Because they've taken their criminals off the street and they've given them to her to put into our country.,
And this will be one of the greatest mistakes in history for them to allow.,
And I think they probably did it because they think they're going to get votes.,
But it's not worth it because they're destroying the fabric of our country by what they've done.,
There's never been anything done like this at all.,
They've destroyed the fabric of our country.,
Millions of people let in and all over the world.,
down all over the world except here.,
Crime here is up and through the roof.,
"Despite their fraudulent statements that they made, crime in this country is through the roof.",
And we have a new form of crime.,
It's called migrant crime.,
And it's happening at levels that nobody thought possible.,
"But Vice President Harris, I'll give you the- Excuse me, the FBI defraud, they were defrauding statements.",
They didn't include the worst cities.,
They didn't include the cities with the worst crime.,
"It was a fraud, just like their number of 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud.",
"President Trump, thank you.",
"I'll let you respond, Vice President Harris.",
"Well, I think this is so rich, coming from someone who has been prosecuted.",
"for national security crimes, economic crimes, election interference, has been found liable for sexual assault, and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing.",
And let's be clear where each person stands on the issue of what is important about respect for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement.,
"The former vice president called for defunding federal law enforcement, 45,000 agents, get this, on the day after he was arraigned on 34 felony counts.",
So let's talk about what is important in this race.,
"It is important that we move forward, that we turn the page on this same old tired rhetoric and address the needs of the American people, address what we need to do about the housing shortage, which I have a plan for, address what we must do to support our small businesses, address bringing down the price of groceries.",
"But frankly, the American people are exhausted with this same old tired playbook.",
" Vice President Harris, thank you.",
Excuse me.,
Every one of those cases was started by them against their political opponent.,
"And I'm winning most of them, and I will win the rest on appeal.",
And you saw that with the decision that came down just recently from the Supreme Court.,
I'm winning most of them.,
But those are cases.,
It's called weaponization.,
Never happened in this country.,
They weaponized the Justice Department.,
"Every one of those cases was involved with the DOJ, from Atlanta and Fawnie Willis to the...  Attorney General of New York and the DA in New York, every one of those cases.",
"And then they say, oh, he was he's a criminal.",
They're the ones that made them go after me.,
"By the way, Joe Biden was found essentially guilty on the documents case.",
And what happened in my documents case?,
"They said, oh, that's the toughest of them all.",
A complete and total victory.,
"Two months ago, it was thrown out.",
"It's weaponization, and they used it, and it's never happened in this country.",
They used it to try and win an election.,
" Well, let's talk about extreme and understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place.",
The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the White House again.,
"Understand this is someone who has openly said he would terminate, I'm quoting, terminate the Constitution of the United States.",
That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies.,
"Someone who has openly expressed disdain  for members of our military understand what it would mean if Donald Trump were back in the White House with no guardrails, because certainly we know now the court won't stop him.",
We know J.D.,
Vance is not going to stop him.,
It's up to the American people to stop him.,
"This is the one that weaponized, not me.",
She weaponized.,
I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me.,
They talk about democracy.,
I'm a threat to democracy.,
"They're the threat to democracy with a fake Russia, Russia, Russia investigation that went nowhere.",
" So my values have not changed, and I'm going to discuss every one of the – at least every point that you've made.",
"But in particular, let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania.",
I made that very clear in 2020.,
I will not ban fracking.,
I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States.,
"And in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking.",
My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil.,
We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil.,
"As it relates to my values, let me tell you, I grew up a middle class kid raised by a hardworking mother.",
who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager.,
The values I bring to the importance of home ownership knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times.,
"is a value that I bring to my work to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes by the end of my first term.",
My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather  And my focus then on protecting women and children from violent crime is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable.,
My work that is about protecting Social Security and Medicare  is based on longstanding work that I have done protecting seniors from scams.,
My values have not changed.,
And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down.,
"And name-calling, the true measure of the leader,  is the leader who actually understands the strength is not in beating people down, it's in lifting people up.",
I intend to be that president.,
"President Trump, your response?",
"Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million.",
I wish I was.,
"My father was a Brooklyn builder, Brooklyn Queens, and a great father, and I learned a lot from him.",
"But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars, many, many billions.",
"And when people see it, they are even surprised.",
So we don't have to talk about that.,
Fracking?,
She's been against it for 12 years.,
Defund the police.,
She's been against that forever.,
She gave all that stuff up.,
"very wrongly, very horribly, and everybody's laughing at it, okay?",
They're all laughing at it.,
She gave up at least 12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies.,
"Like, she was big on defund the police.",
"In Minnesota, she went out, wait a minute, I'm talking now, if you don't mind, please.",
Does that sound familiar?,
She went out.,
"She went out in Minnesota and wanted to let criminals that killed people, that burned down Minneapolis, she went out and raised money to get them out of jail.",
She did things that nobody would ever think of.,
Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.,
This is a radical left liberal that would do this.,
"She wants to confiscate your guns, and she will never allow fracking in Pennsylvania.",
"If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one.",
"Just to finish one thing, so important in my opinion.",
So I got the oil business going like nobody has ever done before.,
"They took, when they took over, they got rid of it, started getting rid of it, and the prices were going up the roof.",
They immediately let these guys go to where they were.,
"I would have been five times, four times, five times higher, because you're talking about three and a half years ago.",
"They got it up to where I was because they had no choice, because the prices of energy were quadrupling and doubling.",
You saw what happened to gasoline.,
"So they said, let's go back to Trump.",
"But if she won the election the day after that election,  They'll go back to destroying our country, and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead.",
"We'll go back to windmills, and we'll go back to solar, where they need a whole desert to get some energy to come out of.",
You ever see a solar plant?,
"By the way, I'm a big fan of solar.",
"But they take...  400, 500 acres of desert soil.",
"These are not good things for the environment, as she understands.",
 You just said a thing that isn't covered.,
"Peacefully and patriotically, I said during my speech, not later on.",
Peacefully and patriotically.,
And nobody on the other side was killed.,
Ashley Babbitt was shot by an out of control police officer.,
"that should have never, ever shot her.",
It's a disgrace.,
But we didn't do this group of people that have been treated so badly.,
"I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people that she allowed to pour in?",
She was the border czar.,
Remember that.,
She was the border czar.,0.0
She doesn't want to be called the border czar because she's embarrassed by the border.,
"In fact, she said at the beginning, oh, I'm surprised you're not talking about the border yet.",
That's because she knows what a bad job they've done.,
What about those people?,
When are they going to be prosecuted?,
"When are these people from countries all over the world, not just South America, they're coming in from all over the world, David, all over the world, and crime rates are down all over the world because of it.",
But let me just ask you.,
"David, when are those people going to be prosecuted?",
When are the people that burned down Minneapolis going to be prosecuted?,
"Or in Seattle, they went into Seattle, they took over a big percentage of the city of Seattle.",
When are those people going to be prosecuted?,
You might ask her that question.,
 I had nothing to do with that other than they asked me to make a speech.,
I showed up for a speech.,
"I said, I think it's going to be big.",
"I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know.",
"I said, you know, this is going to be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it.",
"And again, it wasn't done by me.",
It was done by others.,
"I said, I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers.",
They rejected me.,
Nancy Pelosi rejected me.,
It was just two weeks ago.,
Her daughter has a tape of her saying she is fully responsible for what happened.,
They want to get rid of that tape.,
It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs.,
I wasn't responsible for security.,
Nancy Pelosi was responsible.,
She didn't do her job.,
 I was at the Capitol on January 6th.,
I was the vice president-elect.,
I was also an acting senator.,
I was there.,
"And on that day, the President of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nation's Capitol, to desecrate our nation's Capitol.",
"On that day, 140 law enforcement officers were injured, and some died.",
"And understand, the former president has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason.",
But this is not an isolated situation.,
"Let's remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing anti-Semitic hate.",
And what did the president then at the time say?,
There were fine people on each side.,
Let's remember.,
"that when it came to the Proud Boys, a militia, the president said, the former president said, stand back and stand by.",
"So for everyone watching who remembers what January 6th was, I say, we don't have to go back.",
Let's not go back.,
We're not going back.,
It's time to turn the page.,
"And if that was a bridge too far for you, well, there is a place in our campaign for you to stand for country, to stand for our democracy, to stand for rule of law, and to end the chaos  and to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy because you don't like the outcome.",
And be clear on that point.,
"Donald Trump, the candidate, has said in this election there will be a bloodbath if this and the outcome of this election is not to his liking.",
Let's turn the page on this.,
Let's not go back.,0.0
Let's chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past.,
" It was a different term, and it was a term that related to energy, because they have destroyed our energy business.",
That was where bloodbath was.,
"Also, on Charlottesville, that story has been, as you would say, debunked.",
"Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Jesse, all of these people, they covered it.",
"If they go an extra sentence, they will see it was perfect.",
"It was debunked in almost every newspaper, but they still bring it up, just like they bring 2025 up.",
They bring all of this stuff up.,
I ask you this.,
You talk about the Capitol.,
Why are we allowing these millions of people to come through on the southern border?,
How come she's not doing anything?,
"And I'll tell you what I would do, and I would be very proud to do it.",
I would say we would both leave this debate right now.,
"I'd like to see her go down  to washington dc during this debate because we're wasting a lot of time go down to because she's been so bad it's so ridiculous go down to washington dc and let her sign a bill to close up the border because they have the right to do it they don't need bills they have the right to do the president of the united states you'll get them out of bed you'll wake them up at four o'clock in the afternoon you'll say come on come on down to the office let's sign a bill  If he signs a bill that the border is closed, all he has to do is say it to the border patrol, who are phenomenal.",
"If they do that, the border is closed.",
"Those people are killing many people, unlike J6.",
I said that?,
"No, I don't acknowledge that at all.",
But you did say that.,
I said that sarcastically.,
You know that.,
"We said, oh, we lost by a whisker.",
That was said sarcastically.,
Look...,
There's so much proof.,
All you have to do is look at it.,
And they should have sent it back to the legislatures for approval.,
"I got almost 75 million votes, the most votes any sitting president has ever gotten.",
"I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten.",
"The election, people should never be thinking about an election as fraudulent.",
We need two things.,
We need walls.,
"We need, and we have to have it.",
We have to have borders and we have to have good elections.,
Our elections are bad.,
"And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote.",
They can't even speak English.,
They don't even know what country they're in practically.,
And these people are trying to get them to vote.,
And that's why they're allowing them to come into our country.,
No judge looked at it.,
They said we didn't have standing.,
That's the other thing.,
"They said we didn't have standing, a technicality.",
Can you imagine a system where a person in an election doesn't have standing?,
The President of the United States doesn't have standing.,
That's how we lost.,
"If you look at the facts, and I'd love to have you do a special on it.",
"I'll show you Georgia, and I'll show you Wisconsin, and I'll show you Pennsylvania, and I'll show you... We have so many facts and statistics.",
But you know what?,
"That doesn't matter, because we have to solve the problem that we have right now.",
That's old news.,
"And the problem that we have right now is we have a nation in decline, and they have put it into decline.",
"We have a nation that is dying, David.",
 Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people.,
So let's be clear about that.,
And clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that.,
"But we cannot afford to have a President of the United States who attempts, as he did in the past, to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election.",
"And I'm going to tell you that I have traveled the world as Vice President of the United States, and world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump.",
"I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you, and they say you're a disgrace.",
"And when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny what over and over again are court cases you have lost because you did, in fact, lose that election, it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have in the candidate to my right the temperament  or the ability to not be confused about fact.",
"That's deeply troubling, and the American people deserve better.",
Let me just tell you about world leaders.,
"Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men.",
They call him a strong man.,
He's a tough person.,
Smart.,
Prime Minister of Hungary.,
"They said, why is the whole world blowing up?",
"Three years ago, it wasn't.",
Why is it blowing up?,
"He said, because you need Trump back as president.",
They were afraid of him.,
China was afraid.,
"And I don't like to use the word afraid, but I'm just quoting him.",
China was afraid of him.,
North Korea was afraid of him.,
"Look at what's going on with North Korea, by the way.",
He said Russia was afraid of him.,
I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one.,
But he ended the XL pipeline.,
"The XL pipeline in our country, he ended that, but he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany, the biggest pipeline in the world.",
"Look, Viktor Orban  said it.",
"He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump.",
We had no problems when Trump was president.,
"But when this weak, pathetic man that you saw at a debate just a few months ago, that if he weren't in that debate, he'd be running instead of Hearst.",
He got no votes.,
He got 14 million votes.,
"What you did, you talk about a threat to democracy.",
He got 14 million votes and they threw him out of office.,
And you know what?,
I'll give you a little secret.,
He hates her.,
He can't stand her.,
But he got 14 million votes.,
They threw him out.,
She got zero votes.,
"And when she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed.",
And now she's running.,
"I don't understand it, but I'm OK with it because I think we're going to do very well.",
 nearly 100 hostages remain just last week prime minister benjamin netanyahu said there's not a deal in the making president biden has not been able to break through the stalemate how would you do it well let's understand how we got here on october 7 hamas a terrorist organization slaughtered 1200 israelis many of them young people who are simply attending a concert  women were horribly raped.,
"And so absolutely, I said then, I say now, Israel has a right to defend itself.",
We would.,
"And how it does so matters, because it is also true, far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, children, mothers.",
What we know is that this war must end.,
"It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal and we need the hostages out.",
And so we will continue to work around the clock on that.,
work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution.,
"And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and an equal measure for the Palestinians.",
"But the one thing I will assure you always,  I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel.",
"But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination, and the dignity they so rightly deserve.",
"If I were president, it would have never started.",
"If I were president, Russia would have never, ever, I know Putin very well, he would have never, and there was no threat of it either, by the way, for four years, have gone into Ukraine and killed millions of people when you add it up.",
Far worse than people understand what's going on over there.,
"But when she mentions about Israel, all of a sudden, she hates Israel.",
She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech.,
She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers.,
She wanted to go to the sorority party.,
"she hates israel if she's president i believe that israel will not exist within two years from now and i've been pretty good at predictions and i hope i'm wrong about that one she hates israel at the same time in her own way she hates the arab population because the whole place is going to get blown up arabs  Jewish people, Israel, Israel will be gone.",
It would have never happened.,
Iran was broke under Donald Trump.,
Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had.,
Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different  uh... spheres of terror and they are spheres of terror horrible terror they had no money it was a big story and you know it you covered it very well actually they had no money for terror they were broke now they're a rich nation and now what they're doing is they're spreading that money around  Look at what's happening with the Houthis and Yemen.,
Look at what's going on in the Middle East.,
This would have never happened.,
I will get that settled and fast and I'll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended.,
"If I'm president elect, I'll get it done before even becoming president.",
That's absolutely not true.,
I have  my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people.,
He knows that.,
"He's trying to, again, divide and distract from the reality, which is it is very well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy.",
"It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one, according to himself.",
It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine.,
"It is well known that he said when Russia went into Ukraine, it was brilliant.",
It is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong-un.,
And it is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because they're so clear they can manipulate you with flattery and favors.,
And that is why  So many military leaders who you have worked with have told me you are a disgrace.,
"That is why we understand that we have to have a president who is not consistently weak and wrong on national security, including the importance of upholding and respecting in highest regard our military.",
" and she's the one that caused it, that's weak on national security by allowing every nation last month for the year, 168 different countries, sending people into our country.",
Their crime rates are way down.,
"Putin endorsed her last week, said, I hope she wins.",
And I think he meant it.,
because what he's gotten away with is absolutely incredible.,
It wouldn't have happened with me.,
"The leaders of other countries think that they're weak and incompetent, and they are.",
They're grossly incompetent.,
And I just ask one question.,
"Why does Biden go in and kill the Keystone pipeline and approve the single biggest deal that Russia's ever made, Nord Stream 2, the biggest pipeline anywhere in the world, going to Germany and all over Europe?",
because they're weak and they're ineffective.,
"And Biden, by the way, gets paid a lot of money.",
I want the war to stop.,
I want to save lives that are being uselessly people being killed by the millions.,
It's the millions.,
"It's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting, which are fake numbers.",
Look.,
"We're in for $250 billion or more because they don't ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are.",
They're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with NATO.,
"They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not going to protect you anymore.",
So that's maybe one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people.,
You take a look at what's happening.,
We're in for 250 to 275 billion.,
They're into 100 to 150.,
They should be forced to equalize.,
"With that being said, I want to get the war settled.",
"I know Zelenskyy very well, and I know Putin very well.",
"I have a good relationship, and they respect  You're president, okay?",
They respect me.,
They don't respect Biden.,
How would you respect him?,
Why?,
For what reason?,
"He hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin, hasn't spoken to anybody.",
They don't even try and get it.,
That is a war that's dying to be settled.,
I will get it settled before I even become president.,
"If I win, when I'm president-elect, and what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get them together, that war would have never happened.",
"And, in fact, when I saw Putin after I left,  unfortunately left because our country has gone to hell.",
"But after I left, when I saw him building up soldiers, he did it after I left.",
"I said, oh, he must be negotiating.",
"It must be a good, strong point of negotiation.",
"Well, it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him.",
He had no idea how to stop it.,
And now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War Three.,
"Don't kid yourself, David.",
"We're playing with World War III, and we have a president that we don't even know if he's... Where is our president?",
We don't even know if he's a president.,
And just to clarify here...,
They threw him out of a campaign like a dog.,
We don't even know.,
Is he our president?,
But we have a president that doesn't know he's alive.,
"I think it's the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal, because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.",
" Well, first of all, it's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden, you're running against me.",
I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up.,
And that's not who we are as Americans.,
Let's understand what happened here.,
I actually met with Zelensky a few days before Russia invaded.,
"tried through force to change territorial boundaries, to defy one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity.",
And I met with President Zelensky.,
I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself.,
"Days later, I went to NATO's eastern flank, to Poland and Romania.",
"And through the work that I and others did, we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense.",
"And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country.",
"If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.",
"And understand what that would mean, because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine.",
"Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president, and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, which is NATO.",
and what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelensky and the Ukrainians to fight for their independence.,
"Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland.",
"And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.",
" Putin would be sitting in Moscow, and he wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women.",
But he would have been sitting in Moscow.,
"Quiet, please.",
He would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now.,
"But eventually, you know, he's got a thing that other people don't have.",
He's got nuclear weapons.,
They don't ever talk about that.,
He's got nuclear weapons.,0.0
Nobody ever thinks about that.,
"And eventually, maybe he'll use them, and maybe he hasn't been that threatening.",
"But he does have that, something we don't even like to talk about.",
Nobody likes to talk about it.,
"But just so you understand, they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started.",
"Three days later, he went in and he started the war, because everything they said was weak and stupid.",
They said the wrong things.,
That war should have never started.,
She was the emissary.,
They sent her in to negotiate with Zelensky and Putin.,
And she did.,
And the war started three days later.,
And that's the kind of talent we have with her.,
"She's worse than Biden, in my opinion.",
I think he's the worst president in the history of our country.,
She goes down as the worst vice president in the history of our country.,
But let me tell you something.,
She is a horrible negotiator.,
They sent her in to negotiate.,
"As soon as they left, Putin did the invasion.",
"Yet again, I said at the beginning of this debate, you're going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fellow.",
And that is another one.,
"When I went to meet with President Zelensky, I've now met with him over five times.",
"The reality is it has been about standing as America always should, as a leader upholding international rules and norms, as a leader who shows strength understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strongmen instead of caring about democracy.",
And that is very much what is at stake here.,
The president of the United States is commander in chief and the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the benefit of personal flattery.,
General Stoltenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen.,
"He got these countries, the 28 countries at the time,  to pay up.",
"He said, I've never seen.",
He's the head of NATO.,
"He said, I've never seen.",0.0
"For years, we were paying almost all of NATO.",
"We were being ripped off by European nations, both on trade and on NATO.",
"I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, if you don't pay, we're not going to protect you.",
"Otherwise, we would have never gotten it.",
He said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he's ever seen done.,
" Well, I will tell you, I agreed with President Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan.",
"Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did.",
"And as a result, America's taxpayers are not paying the $300 million a day we were paying for that endless war.",
"And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.",
But let's understand how we got to where we are.,
"Donald Trump, when he was president, negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine.",
He calls himself a dealmaker.,
"Even his national security advisor said it was a weak, terrible deal.",
And here's how it went down.,
He bypassed the Afghan government.,
He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban.,
"The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 Taliban terrorists released.",
And get this.,
"No, get this.",
And the president at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David.,
"a place of storied significance for us as Americans, a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy, where we invite and receive respected world leaders.",
"And this former president, as president, invited them  to Camp David because he does not again appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be Commander in Chief with a level of respect.",
"And this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military, fallen soldiers, and the work that we must do to uphold the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world.",
"Yeah, thank you.",
"So if you take a look at that period of time, the Taliban was killing our soldiers, a lot of them, with snipers.",
And I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing.,
That's the fighting force within Afghanistan.,
"They don't bother doing that because, you know, they deal with the wrong people all the time.",
But I got involved.,
And Abdul is the head of the Taliban.,
He is still the head of the Taliban.,
"And I told Abdul, don't do it anymore.",
"You do it anymore, you're going to have problems.",
"And he said, why do you send me a picture of my house?",
"I said, you're going to have to figure that out, Abdul.",
"And for 18 months, we had nobody killed.",
We did have an agreement negotiated by Mike Pompeo.,
It was a very good agreement.,
"The reason it was good, it was we were getting out.",
"We would have been out faster than them, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers.",
We wouldn't have left many Americans behind.,
"And we wouldn't have left, we wouldn't have left  $85 billion worth of brand-new, beautiful military equipment behind.",
"And just to finish, they blew it.",
"The agreement said, you have to do this, this, this, this, this, and they didn't do it.",
They didn't do it.,
The agreement was...  was terminated by us because they didn't do what they were supposed to do i want to move and these people did the worst withdrawal and in my opinion the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country and by the way that's why russia attacked ukraine because they saw how incompetent she and her boss are president trump thank you,
"I don't, and I don't care.",
I don't care what she is.,
I don't care.,
"You make a big deal out of something, I couldn't care less.",
Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.,
I don't know.,
"I mean, all I can say is I read where she was not black that she put out.",
And I'll say that.,
And then I read that she was black.,
And that's OK.,
Either one was OK with me.,
That's up to her.,
That's up to her.,0.0
" I think it's, I mean, honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently, over the course of his career, attempted to use race to divide the American people.",
"You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us, and we don't want  this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, and especially by race.",
And let's remember how Donald Trump started.,
"He was a land, he owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent,  property to black families.",
"Let's remember this is the same individual who took out a full page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution of five young black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five.",
took out a full-page ad calling for their execution.,
This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first black president of the United States.,
"And I think the American people want better than that, want better than this, want someone who understands, as I do, I travel our country.",
We see in each other a friend.,
We see in each other a neighbor.,
We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other.,
"I meet with people all the time who tell me, can we please just have discourse about how we're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people?",
"knowing that regardless of people's color or the language their grandmother speaks, we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.",
This is the most divisive presidency in the history of our country.,
There's never been anything like it.,
"They're destroying our country, and they come up with things like  what she just said, going back many, many years, when a lot of people, including Mayor Bloomberg, agreed with me on the Central Park Five.",
"They admitted, they said, they pled guilty.",
"And I said, well, if they pled guilty, they'd badly hurt a person, killed a person, ultimately.",
"And if they pled guilty, then they pled we're not guilty.",
"But this is a person that has to stretch back years, 40, 50 years ago, because there's nothing now.",
"I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world, and I'm going to build it again.",
"It's going to be bigger, better, and stronger.",
But they're destroying our economy.,
They have no idea what a good economy is.,
"Their oil policies, every single policy.",
And remember this.,
She is Biden.,
"You know, she's trying to get away from Biden.",
"I don't know the gentleman, she says.",
She is Biden.,0.0
The worst inflation we've ever had.,
A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad.,
And she can't get away with that.,
Thank you.,
Your time is up.,
"I want to respond to that, though.",
I want to just respond briefly.,
"Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump.",
"And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country, one who believes in what is possible, one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people.",
"I believe in what we can do to  strengthen our small businesses, which is why I have a plan.",
Let's talk about our plans and let's compare the plans.,
"I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction.",
"to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work.",
"I have a plan, $6,000 for young families for the first year of your child's life to help you in that most critical stage of your child's development.",
I have a plan.,
"that is about allowing people to be able to pursue what has been fleeting in terms of the American dream by offering a help with down payment of $25,000 down payment assistance for first time home buyers.",
"That's the kind of conversation I believe, David, that people really want tonight as opposed to a conversation that is constantly about belittling and name calling.",
Let's turn the page and move forward.,
"President Trump, we have to move on.",
She has a plan to defund the police.,
She has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun.,
She has a plan to not allow fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else.,
That's what her plan is until just recently.,
 The former president has said something twice that I need to respond to.,
I just need to respond one time to what he has said multiple times.,
Obamacare was lousy health care.,
Always was.,
It's not very good today.,
"And what I said, that if we come up with something and we are working on things, we're going to do it and we're going to replace it.",
But remember this.,
I inherited Obamacare because Democrats wouldn't change it.,
They wouldn't vote for it.,
They were unanimous.,
They wouldn't vote to change it.,
"If they would have done that, we would have had a much better plan than Obamacare.",
But the Democrats came up.,
They wouldn't vote for it.,0.0
I had a choice to make when I was president.,
Do I save it and make it as good as it can be?,
Never going to be great.,
Or do I let it rot?,
"And I felt I had an obligation, even though politically it would have been good, to just let it rot and let it go away.",
"I decided, and I told my people, the top people, and they're very good people.",
I have a lot of good people in that administration.,
We read about the bad ones.,
"We had some real bad ones, too, and so do they.",
They have really bad ones.,
The difference is they don't get rid of them.,
But let me just explain.,
I had a choice to make.,
"Do I save it and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot?",
And I saved it.,
I did the right thing.,
"But it's still never going to be great, and it's too expensive for people.",
And what we will do is we're looking at different plans.,
"If we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population, less money, and be better healthcare than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it.",
"But until then, I'd run it as good as it can be run.",
I have concepts of a plan.,
"I'm not president right now, but if  We come up with something.",
I would only change it if we come up with something that's better and less expensive.,
And there are concepts and options we have to do that.,
And you'll be hearing about it in the not too distant future.,
" Well, first of all, I absolutely support and over the last four years as vice president private health care options.",
But what we need to do is maintain and grow the Affordable Care Act.,
"But I'll get to that, Lindsay.",
I just need to respond to a previous point that the former president has made.,
I've made very clear my position on fracking and then this business about taking everyone's guns away.,
Tim Walz and I are both gun owners.,
We're not taking anybody's guns away.,
So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff.,
"As it relates to the Affordable Care Act, understand, just look at the history to know where people stand.",
"When Donald Trump was president, 60 times he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, 60 times.",
"I was a senator at the time when I will never forget the early morning hours when it was up for a vote in the United States Senate, and the late, great John McCain, who you have disparaged,  as being, you don't like him, you said at the time, because he got caught.",
He was an American hero.,
"The late, great John McCain, I will never forget that night, walked onto the Senate floor and said, no you don't.",
No you don't.,
No you don't get rid of the Affordable Care Act.,
You have no plan.,
And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with pre-existing conditions.,
"I don't have to tell the people watching tonight, you remember what that was like?",
"Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a grandparent had diabetes?",
"And thankfully, as I've been vice president and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act, we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate drug prices on behalf of you, the American people.",
Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate  drug prices?,
He never did.,
We did.,
And now we have capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month.,
"Since I've been vice president, we have capped the cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000 a year.",
"And when I am president, we will do that for all people, understanding that the value I bring to this  is that access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.",
"And the plan has to be to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not get rid of it, fast as prologue in terms of where Donald Trump stands on that.",
"Number one, John McCain fought Obamacare for 10 years, but it wasn't only him.",
It was all of the Democrats that kept it going.,
And you know what?,
"We can do much better than Obamacare, much less money.",
"But she won't improve private insurance for people, private medical insurance.",
That's another thing she doesn't want to get.,
"People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money, and they want to have private.",
She wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait.,
Six months for an operation that you need immediately.,
" Well, the former president had said the climate change is a hoax.",
And what we know is that it is very real.,
"You ask anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences, who now is either being denied home insurance or it's being jacked up.",
"You ask anybody who has been the victim of what that means in terms of losing their home, having nowhere to go.",
We know that we can actually deal with this issue.,
The young people of America care deeply about this issue.,
"And I am proud that as Vice President over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production,  to historic levels.",
"We have created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I have been vice president.",
We have invested in clean energy to the point that we are opening up factories around the world.,
Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs.,
He lost manufacturing jobs.,
"And I'm also proud to have the endorsement of the United Auto Workers and Sean Fain, who also know that part of building a clean energy economy includes investing in American-made products, American automobiles, it includes.",
"growing what we can do around American manufacturing and opening up auto plants, not closing them like happened under Donald Trump.",
"Vice President Harris, thank you.",
It didn't happen under Donald Trump.,
"Let me just tell you, they lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs this last month.",
It's going.,
They're all leaving.,
"They're building big auto plants in Mexico, in many cases owned by China.",
"They're building these massive plants, and they think they're going to sell their cars into the United States because of these people.",
What they have given to China is unbelievable.,
But we're not going to let that.,
"We'll put tariffs on those cars so they can't come into our country, because they will kill  The United Auto Workers and any auto worker, whether it's in Detroit or South Carolina or any other place, what they've done to business and manufacturing in this country is horrible.",
We have nothing because they refuse.,
"You know, Biden doesn't go after people because supposedly China paid him millions of dollars.",
He's afraid to do it between him and his son.,
They get all this money from Ukraine.,
They get all this money from all of these different countries.,
"And then you wonder, why is he so loyal to this one, that one, Ukraine, China?",
Why is he?,
Why did he get $3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow's wife?,
"Why did he get, why did she pay him $3.5 million?",
"This is a crooked administration, and they're selling our country down the tubes.",
"President Trump, thank you.",
Thank you.,
So I think you've heard tonight two very different visions for our country.,
One that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past and an attempt to take us backward.,
But we're not going back.,
And I do believe that the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us.,
And we can chart a new way forward.,
"And a vision of that includes having a plan, understanding the aspirations, the dreams, the hopes, the ambition of the American people, which is why I intend to create  an opportunity economy, investing in small businesses, in new families, in what we can do around protecting seniors, what we can do that is about giving hardworking folks a break and bringing down the cost of living.",
"I believe in what we can do together that is about sustaining America's standing in the world and ensuring that we have the respect that we so rightly deserve, including respecting our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world.",
"I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.",
"I'll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor.",
"I was a DA, I was an Attorney General, a United States Senator, and now Vice President.",
"I've only had one client, the people.",
"And I'll tell you, as a prosecutor, I never asked a victim or a witness, are you a Republican or a Democrat?",
"The only thing I ever asked them, are you okay?",
"And that's the kind of president we need right now, someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first.",
"I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on what we can do over the next 10 and 20 years to build back up our country by investing right now in you, the American people.",
" So she just started by saying she's gonna do this, she's gonna do that, she's gonna do all these wonderful things.",
Why hasn't she done it?,
She's been there for three and a half years.,
They've had three and a half years to fix the border.,
They've had three and a half years to  create jobs and all the things we talked about.,
Why hasn't she done it?,0.0
"She should leave right now, go down to that beautiful White House, go to the Capitol, get everyone together and do the things you want to do.",
But you haven't done it and you won't do it because you believe in things that the American people don't believe in.,
"You believe in things like we're not going to frack, we're not going to take fossil fuel, we're not going to do things that are going to make this country strong, whether you like it or not.",
Germany tried that.,
"And within one year, they were back to building normal energy plants.",
We're not ready for it.,
We can't sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision.,
But I just ask one simple question.,
Why didn't she do it?,
We're a failing nation.,
We're a nation that's in serious decline.,
We're being laughed at all over the world.,
"All over the world, they laugh.",
I know the leaders very well.,
They're coming to see me.,
They call me.,
We're laughed at all over the world.,
They don't understand what happened to us as a nation.,
We're not a leader.,
We don't have any idea what's going on.,
We have wars going on in the Middle East.,
We have wars going on with Russia and Ukraine.,
"We're going to end up in a Third World War, and it'll be a war like no other because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry.",
I rebuilt our entire military.,
She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban.,
She gave it to Afghanistan.,
What these people have done to our country and maybe toughest of all is allowing millions of people to come into our country.,
Many of them are criminals and they're destroying our country.,
"The worst president, the worst vice president in the history of our country.",
