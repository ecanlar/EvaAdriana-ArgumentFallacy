I have a plan -- not a secret plan.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.",0.0
"It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing.",0.0
"Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible.",0.0
"Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.",0.0
"Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.",0.0
We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.,0.0
"The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.",0.0
"In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.",0.0
"So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.",0.0
"And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.",0.0
The deficit is the result of excessive government spending.,0.0
"I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with.",0.0
But it has taken place.,0.0
"But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.",0.0
If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we're not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.,0.0
"At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.",0.0
"And so, I think that the lines can meet.",0.0
"Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.",0.0
One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.,0.0
And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.,0.0
"I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.",0.0
"But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion.",0.0
We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.,0.0
It was $200 billion deficit instead.,0.0
And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.,0.0
"Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.",0.0
"In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.",0.0
It gets larger even with growth.,0.0
What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.,0.0
This is the worst trade year in American history by far.,0.0
Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.,0.0
"Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.",0.0
I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair.,0.0
"I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.",0.0
"I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.",0.0
"These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.",0.0
The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed.,0.0
"Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000.",0.0
And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.,1.0
"And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.",0.0
Yes.,0.0
I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.,0.0
"And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.",0.0
"And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.",0.0
"So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.",0.0
"Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.",0.0
"But I'm going to violate that rule and say ""never.''",0.0
I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.,0.0
"Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.",0.0
"And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.",0.0
Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.,0.0
There's a difference.,0.0
"I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.",0.0
"Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.",0.0
"There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.",0.0
And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.,0.0
The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.,0.0
No one else believes that's the case.,0.0
"I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.",0.0
I think that's what leadership is all about.,0.0
"There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.",0.0
"What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.",0.0
"Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.",0.0
"The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.",0.0
"There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.",0.0
"Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him.",0.0
"It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.",0.0
"I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.",0.0
And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.,0.0
I am answering your questions.,0.0
"I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.",0.0
"And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.",0.0
"And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is.",0.0
"He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.",0.0
"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.",0.0
"And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.",0.0
"Now, leadership.",0.0
"First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.",0.0
"In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.",1.0
"Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.",0.0
I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.,0.0
"And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.",1.0
"You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.",0.0
But I also believe something else about that.,0.0
"I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.",0.0
I don't want to hear them.,0.0
I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?,0.0
"And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.",0.0
"Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",0.0
Our policy was not to cut subsidies.,0.0
"We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.",0.0
"And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.",0.0
"We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.",0.0
"We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.",0.0
"We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.",0.0
"The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.",0.0
"Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.",0.0
"He said, ""It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''",0.0
It's not an opinion; it's a fact.,0.0
"And when the President was asked the other day, ""What do you want to cut in the budget?",0.0
"'', he said, ""Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''",0.0
The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.,0.0
"So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.",0.0
"This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there.",0.0
We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.,0.0
"Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security.",0.0
"When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5.",0.0
Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.,0.0
"Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.",0.0
"And so, we made a proposal.",0.0
"And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.",0.0
"And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.",0.0
"Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.",0.0
"And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.",0.0
"And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.",0.0
"Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.",0.0
"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term.",0.0
"But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God.",0.0
"And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.",0.0
And I do resort to prayer.,0.0
"At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.",0.0
"So, it does play a part in my life.",0.0
I have no hesitancy in saying so.,0.0
"And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.",0.0
The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.,0.0
"I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.",0.0
"And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.",0.0
I know the threats that are made against me.,0.0
We all know the possibility of terrorism.,0.0
We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.,0.0
"And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.",0.0
"And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.",0.0
I am a son of a Methodist minister.,0.0
My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.,0.0
"And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.",0.0
And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.,0.0
"Whether that helps or not, I don't know.",0.0
I have a deep religious faith.,0.0
Our family does.,0.0
It is fundamental.,0.0
It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.,0.0
"I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.",0.0
And I think we're all together on that.,0.0
"What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.",0.0
All history tells us that that's a mistake.,0.0
"When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.",0.0
This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.,0.0
That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.,1.0
"And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.",0.0
Thank you.,0.0
No.,0.0
"A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.",0.0
"The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.",0.0
It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.,0.0
"Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.",0.0
"I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.",0.0
"The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.",0.0
"And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.",0.0
A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.,0.0
"These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.",0.0
"With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.",0.0
I'll stand on my record on that.,0.0
"And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.",0.0
"The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.",0.0
And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.,0.0
And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.,0.0
Let's take the example that the President cites.,0.0
I believe in prayer.,0.0
My family prays.,0.0
We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.,0.0
But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?,0.0
Who would write the prayer?,0.0
What would it say?,0.0
How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?,0.0
"It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.",0.0
We don't want that.,0.0
My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.,0.0
"And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.",1.0
The American people want arms control.,1.0
They don't want this arms race.,0.0
And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.,0.0
And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.,0.0
"The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.",1.0
"They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.",0.0
"And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.",0.0
The American people want this environment protected.,0.0
"They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.",1.0
The American people want their children educated.,0.0
"They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.",0.0
The American people want to keep opening doors.,0.0
They want those civil rights laws enforced.,0.0
They want the equal rights amendment ratified.,0.0
They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.,0.0
"And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.",0.0
"I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.",0.0
"Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.",0.0
The President says it'll disappear automatically.,0.0
I've said it's going to take some work.,0.0
I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.,0.0
"Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed.",0.0
"The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.",0.0
"As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",0.0
"Well, again, I'm running on the record.",0.0
I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.,0.0
But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.,0.0
"We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.",0.0
"And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.",0.0
"And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.",0.0
"I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.",0.0
"We have, to one-third of what it was.",0.0
I promised that we would reduce taxes.,0.0
That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.,0.0
But at least it took that burden away from them.,0.0
"I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.",0.0
"I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.",0.0
We have done that.,0.0
"All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.",0.0
And I think this is something the American people see.,0.0
I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.,0.0
"And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.",0.0
We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.,0.0
All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.,0.0
"So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.",0.0
"There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.",0.0
"Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.",1.0
"I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.",1.0
"Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.",0.0
And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.,0.0
"We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.",0.0
"I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.",0.0
"The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.",0.0
The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.,0.0
"I was chairman of ""Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called ""Democrats for Nixon.''",0.0
"Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.",0.0
"And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.",0.0
The President just said that his government is shrinking.,0.0
It's not.,0.0
It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.,0.0
"And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.",0.0
That's where government should not be.,0.0
"Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.",0.0
"And so, my change had come earlier than that.",0.0
I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.,0.0
I found that was rather difficult to do.,0.0
But I finally did it.,0.0
"There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.",0.0
Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.,0.0
The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.,0.0
"The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\1/2\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.",0.0
"All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.",0.0
I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.,1.0
"Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.",0.0
"But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.",0.0
"With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.",0.0
"I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.",0.0
"And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.",0.0
"And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.",0.0
"We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.",0.0
"Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.",0.0
"In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.",1.0
"Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?",0.0
"So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.",0.0
The laws regarding that always were State laws.,0.0
It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.,0.0
Our laws against murder are State laws.,0.0
"So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.",0.0
"As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.",0.0
And no one has approached it from that matter.,0.0
It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.,0.0
I know that some churches do.,0.0
"Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.",0.0
"At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.",0.0
"And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.",0.0
This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.,0.0
"I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.",0.0
The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.,0.0
"Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?",0.0
"I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.",0.0
Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.,0.0
The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.,0.0
"I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.",0.0
Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.,0.0
But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.,0.0
"Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.",0.0
Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.,0.0
That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.,0.0
But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?,0.0
Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?,0.0
"I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.",0.0
"In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.",0.0
We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.,0.0
It's been a good instinct.,0.0
And we're the most religious people on Earth.,0.0
"One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.",0.0
"The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done.",0.0
"And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.",0.0
I don't know the answer to when life begins.,0.0
"And it's not that simple, either.",0.0
You've got another life involved.,0.0
"And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?",0.0
"If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?",0.0
Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?,0.0
It won't work.,0.0
"Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?",0.0
"Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.",0.0
I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.,0.0
I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.,0.0
"That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.",0.0
"But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?",0.0
There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.,0.0
"I agree with that, and that's why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative.",0.0
I'm all for that.,0.0
But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.,0.0
And I don't agree with it.,0.0
"Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing.",0.0
The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.,0.0
"Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.",0.0
"And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.",0.0
It's been a big failure.,0.0
I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.,0.0
I'm opposed to these policies as well.,0.0
"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.",0.0
"Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.",0.0
"That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.",0.0
What does this mean in real life?,0.0
"Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people.",1.0
"He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.",1.0
In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.,1.0
"In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.",1.0
That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.,1.0
And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.,0.0
"The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.",0.0
"Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.",0.0
And his Secretary of the Treasury said he's studying a sales tax or a value-added tax.,0.0
They're the same thing.,0.0
They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.,0.0
"Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial.",0.0
"As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.",0.0
I don't think we can do that for a few years.,0.0
"But at some point, we want to do that as well.",0.0
"You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.",0.0
There you go again.,0.0
[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.,0.0
I'm not going to increase taxes.,0.0
"I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.",0.0
"Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.",0.0
And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.,0.0
"And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.",0.0
"From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.",0.0
"Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.",0.0
It had two features.,0.0
It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time -- there are two more yet to come between now and 1989.,0.0
"At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.",0.0
"Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.",0.0
"And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.",0.0
"Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.",0.0
"The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.",0.0
"But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person.",0.0
"Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.",0.0
"But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.",0.0
"Yes, I had used -- ""last resort'' would always be with me.",0.0
"If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.",0.0
"I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.",0.0
"With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.",0.0
"All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.",0.0
"Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.",0.0
"I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.",0.0
They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.,0.0
"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?",0.0
You remember the last time you said that?,0.0
"You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, ""Oh, no, there you go again, Mr.",0.0
President.'',0.0
And what did you do right after the election?,0.0
You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.,0.0
"And so, when you say, ""There you go again'' -- people remember this, you know.",0.0
Sorry.,0.0
"With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.",0.0
"And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.",0.0
And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.,0.0
All right.,0.0
"Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.",0.0
"Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.",0.0
"It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.",0.0
"On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them.",0.0
"We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.",0.0
It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.,0.0
We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.,0.0
"We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.",0.0
We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.,0.0
We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.,0.0
"Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.",0.0
Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.,0.0
"But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.",0.0
We didn't think that was right.,0.0
"And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.",0.0
"So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.",0.0
"7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.",0.0
That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.,0.0
"I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.",0.0
"I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.",0.0
And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.,0.0
"So, that was the only place that that was used.",0.0
"I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.",0.0
"There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession.",0.0
"We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.",0.0
"Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.",0.0
"Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program.",0.0
"I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.",0.0
Certainly education and training is crucial.,0.0
"If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.",0.0
The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.,0.0
"The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.",0.0
There is no question that the poor are worse off.,0.0
I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.,0.0
But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.,0.0
"How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them -- for example, the disabled, who have no alternative -- how they're going to do better, I don't know.",0.0
"Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.",0.0
One final point if I might.,0.0
"There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.",1.0
"We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.",0.0
That's another reason to get the deficit down.,0.0
I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.,0.0
I think they stand for civil rights.,0.0
"I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.",0.0
They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.,0.0
I think the business community wants to get involved.,0.0
I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.,0.0
I think that's part of it.,0.0
I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.,0.0
"I'm opposed to that, too.",0.0
The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them.,0.0
"And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.",0.0
They were going up.,0.0
"Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.",0.0
The interest rates are based on inflation.,0.0
And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low.,0.0
"I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.",0.0
"Well, it isn't going to go back up.",0.0
We're going to see that it doesn't.,0.0
And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.,0.0
"Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.",0.0
"I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.",0.0
There's no way of glossing around that.,0.0
"Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.",1.0
"Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that.",1.0
That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.,1.0
It's causing high interest rates.,0.0
It's ruining us in trade.,1.0
It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.,0.0
[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.,0.0
I'm going to give the President some credit.,0.0
"I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.",0.0
"What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.",0.0
"I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.",0.0
But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.,0.0
I like President Reagan.,0.0
"And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.",0.0
"Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down.",0.0
"And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.",0.0
"Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.",0.0
It was once called voodoo economics.,1.0
"I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.",0.0
"Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.",0.0
This is how I'm going to get it done.,0.0
"Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.",0.0
And give us a plan.,0.0
What will you cut?,0.0
Whose taxes will you raise?,0.0
Will you finally touch that defense budget?,0.0
Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?,0.0
"If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.",0.0
And that's the way it should be.,0.0
The American people would be in charge.,0.0
"Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.",0.0
"I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82.",0.0
And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.,1.0
"And why I think it is outrageous -- first of all, it isn't true.",0.0
"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?",0.0
Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute? '',0.0
And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.,0.0
"Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?",0.0
Okay.,0.0
"Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.",0.0
I told you never would I do such a thing.,0.0
"But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.",0.0
Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee.,0.0
"If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.",0.0
It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund.,0.0
"So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.",0.0
"Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.",0.0
"And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation.",0.0
And none of these things happened.,0.0
"It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.",0.0
"As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.",0.0
"We have -- our military, the morale is high.",0.0
"I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.",0.0
"And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.",0.0
"But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.",0.0
"There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500.",0.0
"Well, we are the ones who found those.",0.0
I think we've given the American people back their spirit.,0.0
"I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''",0.0
I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.,0.0
I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate.,0.0
"He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.",0.0
The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?,0.0
"Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.",0.0
"If you're middle income, you're about where you were.",0.0
"And if you're modest income, you're worse off.",0.0
That's what the economists tell us.,1.0
But is that really the question that should be asked?,0.0
Isn't the real question is will we be better off?,0.0
Will our children be better off?,0.0
Are we building the future that this nation needs?,0.0
"I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.",0.0
Are we better of with this arms race?,0.0
Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?,0.0
Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?,0.0
Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt?,0.0
Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now -- over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children?,0.0
"Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?",0.0
I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest.,0.0
I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves.,0.0
"And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.",0.0
"When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.",0.0
"America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.",1.0
I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.,0.0
I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.,0.0
"And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.",0.0
"These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.",0.0
That's not fair for our future.,0.0
"I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.",0.0
I believe in opening doors.,0.0
"We won the Olympics, in part, because we've had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women.",0.0
I have been for those efforts all my life.,0.0
The President's record is quite different.,0.0
The question is our future.,0.0
"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''",1.0
"We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.",0.0
I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.,0.0
"Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area.",0.0
"To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.",0.0
That's one of the big disagreements that we have with the President -- that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace  This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.,0.0
"I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.",0.0
"A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.",0.0
"We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America's assets.",0.0
"But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger.",1.0
"The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead.",0.0
"And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.",0.0
A President is called the Commander in Chief.,0.0
And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.,0.0
"We absolutely must, which is why I responded to your first question the way I did.",0.0
It's much more complex.,0.0
You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.,0.0
That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.,0.0
"That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.",0.0
"Strength requires knowledge, command.",0.0
"We've seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.",0.0
"No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds.",0.0
I have ordered an investigation.,0.0
I know that the CIA is already going forward with one.,0.0
"We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.",0.0
And he drew up this manual.,0.0
It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed.,0.0
"And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed.",0.0
"But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.",0.0
"Now, those are the details as we have them.",0.0
"And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that.",0.0
We'll take the proper action at the proper time.,0.0
"I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.",0.0
"So, I can only tell you about the manual -- that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt.",0.0
"But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.",0.0
I'm afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua.,0.0
There's not someone there directing all of this activity.,0.0
"There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America.",0.0
"And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.",0.0
What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?,0.0
He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.,0.0
"A President can't know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws.",0.0
"This manual -- several thousands of which were produced -- was distributed, ordering political assassinations, hiring of criminals, and other forms of terrorism.",0.0
"Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.",0.0
How can this happen?,0.0
How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?,0.0
A President must know these things.,0.0
"I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.",0.0
And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?,0.0
"This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.",0.0
"I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.",0.0
"You've been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating -- that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back.",0.0
"I never, ever conceived of such a thing.",1.0
I never said any such thing.,1.0
"In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that -- or carriers -- that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.",0.0
"But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false.",0.0
"How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been.",0.0
"So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.",0.0
I'm sure that you appreciate that.,0.0
I retract nothing that I have said.,0.0
I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.,1.0
"But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.",0.0
And I told Mr. Gromyko we don't like their system.,0.0
They don't like ours.,0.0
"And we're not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours.",0.0
"But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.",0.0
"And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.",0.0
And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.,0.0
I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.,0.0
"I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly.",0.0
And the result was unilateral disarmament.,0.0
We canceled the B - 1 under the previous administration.,0.0
What did we get for it?,0.0
Nothing.,0.0
"The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.",1.0
And now we are putting up a defense of our own.,0.0
"And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority.",0.0
We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.,0.0
"Now, they claim they're not.",0.0
"And I made it plain to them, we're not.",0.0
There's been no change in my attitude at all.,0.0
I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.,0.0
And we did get their attention.,0.0
"Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.",0.0
"I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.",0.0
"One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there.",0.0
Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.,0.0
"We're working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola.",0.0
"So, I can say there are a great many interests.",0.0
I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.,0.0
That is where I think the future of the world lies.,0.0
"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''",0.0
I don't want to send troops any place.,0.0
"Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether they're living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that they're violating it; and the strongest possible terms.",0.0
I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.,0.0
"They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.",1.0
"Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.",0.0
"And that's where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off.",0.0
"And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.",0.0
"There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.",0.0
"We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.",0.0
There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration.,0.0
I will keep this nation strong.,0.0
"I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.",0.0
"To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.",0.0
"And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.",0.0
"He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work.",0.0
I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.,0.0
"He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation.",0.0
I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.,0.0
We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.,0.0
"We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union.",0.0
"Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.",0.0
That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.,0.0
I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.,0.0
"But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where he's appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F - 14's take off.",0.0
"And that's an image of strength -- except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on -- he was against it.",0.0
"[Laughter] He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.",0.0
And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.,1.0
"Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.",0.0
"And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.",0.0
"Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.",0.0
I'll tell you where we disagree.,0.0
"It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.",0.0
The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.,1.0
Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.,0.0
My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.,0.0
There's a big difference between the two of us.,0.0
A President must manage that budget.,0.0
"I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.",0.0
"You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.",0.0
And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.,0.0
"In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.",1.0
"And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did.",1.0
"Similarly, in Central America: What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.",0.0
"We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.",0.0
And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.,0.0
"We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.",0.0
"We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.",1.0
It is only in that way that we can persevere.,1.0
"What I'm referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps -- diplomatic and otherwise -- to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it.",0.0
"The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations.",0.0
"And by working with all of the nations in the region -- unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region -- we will be much stronger, because we'll have the moral authority that goes with those efforts.",0.0
"No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things.",0.0
"First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.",0.0
"But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.",0.0
Israel could not be blamed for that.,0.0
"Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.",0.0
"Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.",0.0
We departed.,0.0
And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.,0.0
And we were succeeding.,0.0
We were there for the better part of a year.,0.0
Our position happened to be at the airport.,0.0
"Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.",0.0
"I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.",1.0
And this is what we did.,0.0
We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.,0.0
"But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.",0.0
"We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began.",0.0
"There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.",0.0
"And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.",0.0
Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.,0.0
But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.,0.0
And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.,0.0
"Morton, no.",0.0
"I think there's a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.",0.0
"In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over.",0.0
"In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.",0.0
The most recent has been the one in Brighton.,0.0
"In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating.",0.0
"I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.",0.0
"And it's going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago.",0.0
"Well, the red light went on.",0.0
I could have gone on forever.,0.0
"Groucho Marx said, ""Who do you believe?",1.0
"-- me, or your own eyes? ''",1.0
And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.,0.0
The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.,0.0
"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''",0.0
The Secretary of State admitted that this morning.,0.0
He did not do so.,0.0
The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken.,0.0
That was the second time.,0.0
"Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.",0.0
"And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.",0.0
The terrorists have won each time.,0.0
The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.,0.0
He didn't.,0.0
They called their bluff.,0.0
"And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.",0.0
Yes.,0.0
"First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.",0.0
That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there.,0.0
That is one.,0.0
"On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.",0.0
"These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, they're blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think they're going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it.",0.0
"We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.",1.0
"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''",0.0
We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.,0.0
And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice.,0.0
"Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.",0.0
"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.",1.0
"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''",0.0
"Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.",0.0
You and Mr. Mondale have already disagreed about what you had to say about recalling submarine-launched missiles.,0.0
"There's another, a similar issue out there that relates to your -- it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles.",0.0
"First, is that correct?",0.0
"Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime?",0.0
"And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?",0.0
"Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.",0.0
"And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based.",0.0
You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.,0.0
"So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those.",0.0
"The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.",0.0
And we agreed.,0.0
"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''",0.0
"But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.",0.0
"So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?",0.0
"But even after we gave in and said, ""All right, let's discuss it all,'' they walked away from the table.",0.0
We didn't.,0.0
"Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.",0.0
Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?,0.0
"And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be.",0.0
"What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.",0.0
"A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe.",0.0
"I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.",1.0
"He said, ""The buck stops here.''",1.0
"We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.",0.0
What happened?,0.0
"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''",0.0
They did it.,0.0
"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''",0.0
They didn't do it.,0.0
And we know what happened.,0.0
"After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.",0.0
"This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.",0.0
Who's in charge?,0.0
Who's handling this matter?,0.0
That's my main point.,0.0
"Now, on arms control, we're completing 4 years.",0.0
This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress.,0.0
We have an arms race underway instead.,0.0
A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.,0.0
Different people with different views fight with each other.,0.0
"For 3\1/2\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.",0.0
And we have this arms race underway.,0.0
"And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called ""Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control.",1.0
That's why they call the President the Commander in Chief.,0.0
"Good intentions, I grant.",0.0
But it takes more than that.,0.0
You must be tough and smart.,0.0
This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.,0.0
"And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases -- weak, I believe.",0.0
It is a question of leadership.,0.0
"And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America.",0.0
Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?,0.0
And are you prepared to repudiate him now?,0.0
I read his statement the other day.,0.0
I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.,0.0
Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization's history.,0.0
"I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I've worked in a way that demonstrates that.",0.0
But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.,0.0
I don't control him.,0.0
And let's talk about people we do control.,0.0
"In the last debate,\1\ (FOOTNOTE) the Vice President of the United States said that I said the marines had died shamefully and died in shame in Lebanon.",0.0
"I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.",1.0
What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?,0.0
"I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.",0.0
"And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.",0.0
"Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.",0.0
"When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that.",0.0
"The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.",0.0
"There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country -- there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight.",1.0
"One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, ""Deadly Gambits.''",1.0
"The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country.",1.0
"Both said that this administration turned down the ""walk in the woods'' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security.",1.0
"When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired.",0.0
This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.,1.0
Now we have a runaway arms race.,0.0
"All they've got to show for 4 years in U. S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before.",0.0
"They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.",0.0
This one has not.,0.0
"Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that.",0.0
"But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.",0.0
"So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.",0.0
"Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.",0.0
"But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I'll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.",0.0
And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.,0.0
"But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.",0.0
"And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?",0.0
Why not?,0.0
What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?,0.0
"There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon.",0.0
But suppose we came up with that?,0.0
"Now, some people have said, ""Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy.''",0.0
But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?,0.0
"Say, ""Look, here's what we can do.",0.0
We'll even give it to you.,0.0
"Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat? ''",0.0
I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.,0.0
"First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union.",1.0
"We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us.",0.0
"And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.",0.0
"And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.",1.0
I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all.,0.0
"Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?",0.0
There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.,0.0
"If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.",0.0
"But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.",0.0
It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons.,0.0
The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.,0.0
And they always do.,0.0
We don't get behind.,0.0
They won't get behind.,0.0
And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.,0.0
We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.,0.0
"If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.",0.0
One final point.,0.0
"The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.",1.0
That's dead wrong.,1.0
There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers.,1.0
"It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.",1.0
Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?,0.0
Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement.,0.0
I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.,0.0
I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.,0.0
That's why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.,0.0
"Now, why do I support the freeze?",0.0
Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.,1.0
It's more difficult to defend this nation.,0.0
It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.,0.0
"This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.",1.0
-- -- and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop.,0.0
"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?",0.0
"Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- ""Here's what we can do.",0.0
"Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat . . . .'' But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.",0.0
"I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon.",1.0
"And suddenly somebody says, ""Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's Star Wars,'' and so forth.",1.0
"I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.",0.0
"Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be.",0.0
"If they're space weapons, I assume they'll be in space.",0.0
"Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.",0.0
"The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff.",0.0
"And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.",0.0
"You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President.",0.0
"You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.",0.0
This is an arms escalation.,0.0
"If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.",0.0
But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.,0.0
Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure?,0.0
That's what a President's for.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need.",0.0
"And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D - 5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman -- we have a whole range of technology.",0.0
Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.,1.0
It'll draw an attack.,0.0
"It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.",0.0
"And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.",0.0
The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built.,0.0
"Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control.",0.0
"That's why I'm for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber -- which I've supported for years -- that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated.",0.0
"In other words, a President has to make choices.",0.0
This makes us stronger.,0.0
The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.,0.0
Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength.,0.0
"We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons.",0.0
"It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.",0.0
"Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation -- or the world is more dangerous as a result.",0.0
"I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.",0.0
Let's take your warhead principle.,0.0
The warhead principle -- there have been counting rules for years.,0.0
"Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not.",0.0
These are standard rules.,0.0
"I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements.",0.0
I don't trust the Russians.,0.0
"I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.",0.0
"But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.",1.0
"Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran.",0.0
And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.,0.0
"The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down.",0.0
Have things gotten better?,0.0
"The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners -- things of that kind.",0.0
"But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions.",0.0
"The matter of Somoza -- no, I never defended Somoza.",0.0
"And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.",0.0
"And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.",0.0
"And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.",0.0
Many of them are now the contras.,0.0
"They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some.",0.0
And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.,0.0
"And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?",0.0
It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.,0.0
They have been our friend since their inception as a nation.,0.0
"And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.",0.0
"And I think that we're better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.",0.0
"Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.",0.0
"And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.",0.0
And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.,0.0
Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administration's policies on human rights.,0.0
"I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.",0.0
What explains this administration cozying up to the Argentine dictators after they took over?,0.0
"Fortunately, a democracy took over, but this nation was embarrassed by this current administration's adoption of their policies.",0.0
That hurts this nation.,0.0
We need to stand for human rights.,0.0
We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.,0.0
National security and human rights must go together.,0.0
But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.,0.0
"Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didn't take place on our watch.",0.0
"I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either.",0.0
I don't think that our record of human rights can be assailed.,0.0
"I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.",0.0
Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.,0.0
"And I was glad to hear him say that, because that's what we've been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this.",0.0
"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands.",0.0
I think we've seen a deterioration of values.,0.0
I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.,0.0
"For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.",0.0
"So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.",0.0
And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.,0.0
"And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.",0.0
We've got to get after the users more.,0.0
We have to change this whole culture.,0.0
"You know, I saw a movie - ""Crocodile Dundee.""",0.0
"And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.",0.0
And it's bad.,0.0
Everybody ought to be in this thing.,0.0
"Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.",0.0
But we have got to instill values in these young people.,0.0
And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.,0.0
"But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.",0.0
I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.,0.0
But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.,0.0
That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.,0.0
Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.,0.0
We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.,0.0
Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.,0.0
"I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.",1.0
We're providing that young woman with help.,1.0
"Values begin at the top, in the White House.",0.0
Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.,0.0
"I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.",1.0
And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.,0.0
"But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.",1.0
"Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.",0.0
But we also have to take demand seriously.,0.0
"You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.",0.0
We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.,0.0
And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.,1.0
We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.,0.0
"And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.",0.0
"And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.",0.0
"I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.",1.0
"Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.",0.0
I asked for and received the same briefing.,0.0
I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.,0.0
And what I'm about to say is unclassified.,0.0
Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.,0.0
It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.,0.0
"And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.",0.0
And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.,0.0
Panama is a friendly country.,0.0
"I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.",0.0
And we want to bring him to justice.,0.0
And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.,0.0
"Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.",0.0
"And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.",0.0
"First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.",0.0
"Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make.",0.0
"I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.",0.0
"Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.",0.0
Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.,0.0
"Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.",0.0
"And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.",0.0
It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.,1.0
I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.,0.0
"We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.",0.0
"We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.",0.0
The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.,0.0
"He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.",0.0
He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.,0.0
"If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.",1.0
(Laughter)  But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.,0.0
Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?,0.0
That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.,0.0
"There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin.",0.0
"When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.",0.0
John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.,1.0
"Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.",1.0
It's not going to cost the government money.,0.0
"It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.",0.0
So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.,0.0
"Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.",0.0
That happens to be a fact.,0.0
"And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.",0.0
"And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.",1.0
I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.,0.0
"And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.",0.0
"They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.",0.0
"I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto.",0.0
He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.,0.0
I would like a balanced budget amendment.,0.0
But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.,0.0
So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.,0.0
It is that we are continuing to spend too much.,0.0
"So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.",0.0
Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.,0.0
"And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.",0.0
And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.,0.0
Spending was only up something like 4 percent.,0.0
"So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.",0.0
"And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.",1.0
"And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again.",1.0
"Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.",0.0
"A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.",0.0
"Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.",1.0
"What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.",0.0
Why that's more than the average teacher makes.,0.0
"We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.",1.0
We've run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.,0.0
"It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.",0.0
"One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.",0.0
I want to keep this economic recovery going.,0.0
What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.,0.0
I believe that's the answer.,0.0
I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.,0.0
And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.,0.0
But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.,1.0
"So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.",0.0
"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it.""",0.0
And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.,0.0
"All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.",0.0
There isn't any such thing as something free out there.,0.0
It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.,0.0
"So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.",0.0
I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.,0.0
I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.,0.0
It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.,0.0
But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.,0.0
"But, George, that's no answer.",0.0
"You don't like the answer, but it's an answer.",0.0
"Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.",0.0
"I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens.",1.0
All of them with little or no health insurance.,1.0
One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance.,1.0
My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.,0.0
"The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for those who aren't.",0.0
And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.,0.0
That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.,0.0
"Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn't know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts.",0.0
I hope he hasn't.,0.0
Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.,1.0
"But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine.",1.0
"The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don't you?",1.0
It was in 1964 and that's what he called Medicare.,1.0
"Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.",1.0
"It's the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.",1.0
I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.,0.0
And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.,0.0
But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.,0.0
"In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.",0.0
The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.,0.0
I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.,0.0
"Well, we're on the right track.",0.0
The NIH is doing a good job in research.,0.0
The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education.,0.0
"Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge.",0.0
We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.,0.0
I'm Chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help.,0.0
"And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.",0.0
We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.,0.0
"So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.",0.0
"Well, I don't question his passion.",0.0
I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.,0.0
He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.,0.0
"Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.",1.0
He - we have a big difference on issues.,0.0
"You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.",0.0
"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87.",0.0
"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.""",0.0
That was what he said.,0.0
He is out there on out of the mainstream.,0.0
He is very passionate.,0.0
"My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left.",0.0
And I wish we had time to let me explain.,0.0
But I salute him for his passion.,0.0
"We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.",0.0
But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.,0.0
"But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.",0.0
"Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here.",0.0
"I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.",0.0
But I don't agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU.,0.0
I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.,0.0
I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.,0.0
I like those ratings systems.,0.0
I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.,0.0
"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency.",0.0
"Now, these are all positions of the ACLU.",0.0
And I don't agree with them.,0.0
"He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal.",0.0
I don't agree with that.,0.0
And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.,1.0
They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.,1.0
"You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.",1.0
Governor Thompson of Illinois did.,1.0
I'm not questioning his patriotism.,0.0
He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism.,0.0
And then all the liberal columnists join in.,0.0
I am not.,0.0
"I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.",0.0
"But I believe that's not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years.",0.0
"And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.",0.0
And I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.,0.0
"Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.",0.0
"Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.",0.0
"I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.",1.0
I resent it.,1.0
My parents came to this country as immigrants.,0.0
They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.,0.0
I'm in public service because I love this country.,0.0
I believe in it.,0.0
And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.,0.0
The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one's patriotism--the vice president's been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years.,0.0
To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.,0.0
"(Applause)  Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.",0.0
"When you're attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it.",0.0
"I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.",0.0
Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight.,0.0
"Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.",0.0
I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.,0.0
I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.,0.0
"I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.",0.0
The governor's wife has been very active in the homeless.,0.0
"My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife.",0.0
This isn't government.,0.0
"These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.",0.0
The government has a role.,0.0
It is to fully fund the McKinney Act.,0.0
There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.,0.0
And so I think that we're on the right track.,0.0
"I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.",0.0
I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.,0.0
"I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.",0.0
They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.,0.0
"But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it.",0.0
I'd say around 30 percent.,0.0
And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.,0.0
Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.,0.0
Because there is a major problem there.,0.0
A lot of them are mentally sick.,0.0
And we've got to attend to them.,0.0
"But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.",0.0
"Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.",0.0
"The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.",1.0
"And when you do that, you've have homeless families.",1.0
"We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.",0.0
We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.,0.0
We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.,0.0
That's an essential commitment.,0.0
And I think the housing community is ready.,0.0
"But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.",0.0
"And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.",0.0
"We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.",0.0
This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.,0.0
"Well, I certainly hope not.",0.0
And it's all a question of what our priorities are.,0.0
Mr. Bush talked about values.,0.0
I agree with him.,0.0
What are our values?,0.0
"Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?",0.0
I think so.,0.0
"You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around.",0.0
We went out and built housing.,0.0
The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.,0.0
"Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.",0.0
This isn't a question of a little charity for the homeless.,0.0
This is a question of organizing the housing community.,0.0
"I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.",1.0
"Washington, by itself, can't do it all.",0.0
We shouldn't expect that.,0.0
But governors are ready; mayors are ready.,0.0
Builders and community leaders are ready.,0.0
"It will require some funds, John.",0.0
And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.,0.0
"But that, too, will require some choices.",0.0
Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars.,0.0
"Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?",0.0
Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.,0.0
"Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.",0.0
"And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.",0.0
It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.,0.0
I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.,0.0
Let's talk about housing which the question was.,0.0
"When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?",0.0
"Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?",0.0
Housing is up.,0.0
We are serving a million more families now.,0.0
"But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.",0.0
Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort.,0.0
It is wrong.,0.0
I favor home ownership.,0.0
I want to see more vouchers.,0.0
"I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.",0.0
"They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.",0.0
"But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.",1.0
"No, I don't think there is.",0.0
"There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.",0.0
I'm opposed to the death penalty.,0.0
I think everybody knows that.,0.0
I'm also very tough on violent crime.,0.0
And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.,0.0
It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.,0.0
"It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.",0.0
"You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.",1.0
"The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.",0.0
I don't favor abortion.,1.0
I don't think it's a good thing.,1.0
I don't think most people do.,1.0
The question is who makes the decision.,0.0
"And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",0.0
"Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.",0.0
It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.,0.0
The federal program doesn't do that.,0.0
No other state programs do that.,0.0
And I favor the death penalty.,0.0
I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.,1.0
"But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.",1.0
And I do believe it would be inhibiting.,1.0
"And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.",1.0
"Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.",1.0
And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.,0.0
And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.,0.0
I favor adoption.,0.0
I do not favor abortion.,0.0
I haven't sorted out the penalties.,0.0
And I favor adoption.,0.0
"And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.",0.0
"And you see, yes, my position has evolved.",0.0
"And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.",0.0
"And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.",0.0
"Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.",0.0
"See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion.",0.0
We certainly do.,0.0
"But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.",0.0
"Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.",0.0
It's as simple as that.,0.0
"I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.",0.0
"This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.",0.0
"And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.",0.0
"Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.",0.0
I respect his right to disagree with me.,0.0
"One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.",0.0
"But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.",0.0
"That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.",0.0
I do strongly support the WIC program.,0.0
I think it is good.,0.0
"I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.",0.0
"But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.",0.0
"The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.",0.0
"I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.",1.0
I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.,0.0
And so it's a combination of these things.,0.0
But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.,0.0
"The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.",0.0
I'm for Head Start and moving that up.,0.0
But I favor that.,0.0
"So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.",0.0
"Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.",1.0
It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.,0.0
"And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.",0.0
Let me just give you one other example.,0.0
"We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.",0.0
"The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.",0.0
"It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.",1.0
That's the way you help people.,0.0
"Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.",0.0
I know what strong political leadership is.,0.0
I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.,0.0
"These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.",1.0
"Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.",0.0
Welfare reform is one way to do it.,0.0
"If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.",0.0
That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.,0.0
"In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.",0.0
One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.,0.0
Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.,1.0
"And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.",0.0
"So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.",0.0
"Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.",1.0
I know the private sector is.,1.0
People are all over the country.,1.0
But it takes presidential leadership.,0.0
It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.,0.0
And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.,0.0
"What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't understand what I'm talking about.",0.0
This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.,1.0
They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.,0.0
The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.,0.0
It is not down.,0.0
But here's the point he misses.,0.0
"The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.",0.0
"But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better.",0.0
"We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.",0.0
And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.,0.0
And we can do it.,0.0
Of course not.,0.0
Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.,0.0
I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.,1.0
"Remember that, George?",0.0
"And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.",0.0
Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.,0.0
It's not the length of your resume.,0.0
"It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.",0.0
"It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.",0.0
The vice president has a long resume.,0.0
But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.,0.0
"And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.",0.0
His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.,0.0
He went to Philippines in the early 80Ï€s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.,0.0
"And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.",0.0
So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.,0.0
"The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.",0.0
I'm ready to provide that leadership.,0.0
I want to be the commander in chief of this country.,0.0
"I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.",0.0
But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.,0.0
"Well, I thought the question was about defense.",0.0
The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.,0.0
"And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.",0.0
"Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability.",0.0
That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.,0.0
I've met Mr. Gorbachev.,0.0
These people are tough.,0.0
But now we have a chance.,0.0
"I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.",0.0
"And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.",0.0
"As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more.",0.0
It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.,0.0
But I'll tell you what I was thinking of.,0.0
"I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila.",0.0
And he was down there fighting against imperialism.,0.0
And he just called for new elections.,0.0
And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.,0.0
I don't think it's a question of eliminating.,0.0
I can tell him some I'm against.,0.0
And I can go on and on.,0.0
"Minuteman III, penetration systems.",0.0
"I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.",0.0
I'm simply not going to do that.,0.0
We're going to have to-the MX.,1.0
We're going to have to do that.,1.0
It's Christmas.,1.0
(Laughter)  Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?,0.0
wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?,0.0
"These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.",0.0
"Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.",0.0
But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.,0.0
We will do what we do best.,0.0
It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.,0.0
It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.,0.0
"But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.",0.0
We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.,0.0
Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars.,0.0
"He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don't need and can't afford.",0.0
I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.,1.0
I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.,1.0
But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.,0.0
"I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.",0.0
But I don't think we need these other systems.,0.0
I don't think we need them to remain strong.,0.0
"We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.",0.0
"What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.",0.0
Be cautious.,0.0
Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.,0.0
"Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.",0.0
"And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.",0.0
"And when they have a --they a --deals that are good for us, as China started to do--the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature.",0.0
And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.,0.0
We should encourage that.,0.0
We ought to say this is good.,0.0
But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.,0.0
"I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.",0.0
And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.,0.0
You see the turmoil in Poland today.,0.0
And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.,0.0
I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets.,0.0
We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.,0.0
But this is an exciting time.,0.0
But all I'm suggesting is let's not be naÃ¯ve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.,0.0
Look at the INF treaty.,0.0
"And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn.",0.0
The freeze people were wrong.,0.0
The Reagan-Bush administration was right.,0.0
It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.,0.0
"And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery.",0.0
"Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.",0.0
What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.,1.0
"Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.",1.0
"And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.",1.0
We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.,0.0
"We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about.",0.0
But there are opportunities there now.,0.0
Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ï€s and beyond.,0.0
Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.,0.0
"And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home.",0.0
Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.,0.0
We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.,1.0
That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.,0.0
"I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year.",0.0
"And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.",0.0
"So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.",0.0
"Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, â‰¥Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.â‰¤ He hasn't told us where.",0.0
We know where they're cutting.,0.0
We know where you're cutting right now.,0.0
You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.,0.0
You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment.,0.0
"An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.",1.0
"Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.",1.0
"They're supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don't have enough fuel.",0.0
You have to make choices.,0.0
We're not making those choices.,0.0
"And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.",0.0
"We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.",1.0
"We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.",0.0
"They have about 12,000.",0.0
"So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.",0.0
But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.,0.0
That's-at least that's what I read.,0.0
Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.,0.0
I'm not reconsidering my position.,0.0
Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.,0.0
Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.,0.0
He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.,0.0
"The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.",0.0
Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.,1.0
"And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.",0.0
(Applause)  He's got to get this thing more clear.,0.0
Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud?,0.0
"I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.",0.0
"We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.",0.0
That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.,0.0
"Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.",1.0
"These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.",0.0
"Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.",0.0
"But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.",1.0
"Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.",0.0
And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.",0.0
"And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.",1.0
"So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same.",1.0
We've got to be tough on international terrorism.,0.0
We've got to treat it as international crime.,0.0
"We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.",0.0
"We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.",0.0
"Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.",0.0
"That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.",0.0
I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.,0.0
It is the best anti-terrorist report written.,0.0
"Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.",0.0
But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.,0.0
"Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.",0.0
And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.,0.0
"And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.",0.0
And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter.,0.0
And I've said mistakes were made.,0.0
Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.,0.0
That is a very serious charge against the president.,0.0
The matter has been thoroughly looked into.,0.0
"But the point is sometimes the action- (Laughter)  - has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response.",0.0
You're judged by the whole record.,0.0
You're judged by the entire record.,0.0
Are we closer to peace?,0.0
Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?,0.0
"Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there?",0.0
How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.,0.0
Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?,0.0
You judge on the record.,0.0
Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan?,0.0
"How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians don't like it, but the rest of the country will understand.",0.0
(Applause)  Now we have a chance.,0.0
Now we have a chance.,0.0
"And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.",0.0
And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.,0.0
"Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.",0.0
"He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.",0.0
Wait a minute.,0.0
Where was I?,0.0
"25th of December, Mr. Vice President.",0.0
(Laughter)  I finished.,0.0
"He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.",0.0
"Well, the matter of judgment is very important.",0.0
And I think it's important to understand what happened here.,0.0
A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.,0.0
They were ignored.,0.0
The Vice President ignored them.,0.0
He says mistakes were made.,0.0
Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.,0.0
"Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.â‰¤  I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review.",1.0
We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.,0.0
You cannot make concessions to terrorists.,0.0
"If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.",0.0
That's a basic principle.,0.0
It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.,1.0
"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.",1.0
But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.,0.0
"I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies.",0.0
And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.,0.0
"I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.",0.0
"I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.",0.0
But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.",0.0
I oppose supply management and production controls.,0.0
"I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.",0.0
I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.,0.0
I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.,0.0
"I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.",0.0
"In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.",0.0
"I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.",0.0
And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.,0.0
"I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.",0.0
"But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.",1.0
Let's try to expand our markets abroad.,0.0
I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country.,0.0
But there are two main focal points of this election.,0.0
Opportunity and peace.,1.0
I want to keep this expansion going.,0.0
"Yes, we want change but we are the change.",1.0
I am the change.,1.0
I don't want to go back to malaise and misery index.,0.0
"And, so, opportunity.",0.0
Keep America at work.,1.0
The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.,0.0
"And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.",0.0
We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it.,0.0
I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.,0.0
I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.,0.0
And then it gets down to a question of values.,0.0
We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.,0.0
And I do favor the death penalty.,0.0
And we've got a wide array of differences on those.,0.0
"But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they're going to say, â‰¥Who has the values I believe in?",1.0
Who has the experience that we trust?,1.0
Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?,1.0
"â‰¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support.",1.0
Thank you very much.,0.0
Good evening.,0.0
It's great to be here in Atlanta for this debate where America will be showcased to the world when the 1996 Olympics are put on right here.,0.0
"It's appropriate because in a real sense, our discussion this evening will be about what kind of nation we want to be 4 years from now.",0.0
It's also a pleasure to be with my 2 opponents this evening.,0.0
"Admiral Stockdale, may I say it's a special honor to share this stage with you.",0.0
Those of us who served in Vietnam looked at you as a national hero even before you were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.,1.0
"And Mr. Vice President -- Dan, if I may -- it was 16 years ago that you and I went to the Congress on the very first day together.",0.0
I'll make you a deal this evening.,0.0
"If you don't try to compare George Bush to Harry Truman, I won't compare you to Jack Kennedy.",0.0
Do you remember what they said?,0.0
"Harry Truman, it's worth remembering, assumed the presidency when Franklin Roosevelt died here in Georgia -- only one of many occasions when fate thrust a vice president into the Oval Office in a time of crisis.",0.0
It's something to think about during the debate this evening.,0.0
But our real discussion is going to be about change.,0.0
Bill Clinton and I stand for change because we don't believe our nation can stand 4 more years of what we've had under George Bush and Dan Quayle.,0.0
"When the recession came they were like a deer caught in the headlights -- paralyzed into inaction, blinded to the suffering and pain of bankruptcies and people who were unemployed.",1.0
"We have an environmental crisis, a health insurance crisis, substandard education.",0.0
It is time for a change.,1.0
"Well, thank you, Senator Gore, for reminding me about my performance in the 1988 vice presidential debate.",0.0
"This is 1992, Bill Clinton is running against President George Bush.",0.0
"President Bush wants to hold the line on taxes, Bill Clinton wants to raise taxes.",0.0
"President Bush is for a balanced budget amendment, Bill Clinton is opposed to it.",0.0
"We want to reform the legal system because it's too costly, Bill Clinton wants the status quo.",0.0
"We want to reform the health care system, Bill Clinton wants to ration health care.",0.0
"Bill Clinton wants to empower government, we want to empower people.",0.0
"In St. Louis, Missouri, in June of this year, Bill Clinton said this: ""America is the mockery of the world.""",1.0
He is wrong.,0.0
At some time during these next 4 years there is going to be a crisis -- there will be an international crisis.,0.0
"I can't tell you where it's going to be, I can't even tell you the circumstances -- but it will happen.",0.0
"We need a president who has the experience, who has been tested, who has the integrity and qualifications to handle the crisis.",0.0
"The president has been tested, the president has the integrity and the character.",0.0
The choice is yours.,0.0
You need to have a president you can trust.,0.0
Can you really trust Bill Clinton?,0.0
Who am I?,0.0
Why am I here?,0.0
So don't expect me to use the language of the Washington insider.,0.0
"Thirty-seven years in the Navy, and only one of them up there in Washington.",0.0
And now I'm an academic.,0.0
The centerpiece of my life was the Vietnam War.,0.0
I was there the day it started.,0.0
I led the first bombing raid against North Vietnam.,0.0
"I was there the day it ended, and I was there for everything in between.",0.0
"Ten years in Vietnam, aerial combat, and torture.",0.0
I know things about the Vietnam War better than anybody in the world.,0.0
I know some things about the Vietnam War better than anybody in the world.,0.0
"And I know how governments, how American governments can be -- can be courageous, and how they can be callow.",0.0
And that's important.,0.0
That's one thing I'm an insider on.,0.0
I was the leader of the underground of the American pilots who were shot down in prison in North Vietnam.,0.0
You should know that the American character displayed in those dungeons by those fine men was a thing of beauty.,0.0
"I look back on those years as the beginning of wisdom, learning everything a man can learn about the vulnerabilities and the strengths that are ours as Americans.",0.0
Why am I here tonight?,0.0
I am here because I have in my brain and in my heart what it takes to lead America through tough times.,1.0
Thank you.,0.0
The lifeblood of our economy is investment.,1.0
And right now when we pay $350 -- we borrow $350 billion a year it saps the money markets and the private investors are not getting their share.,0.0
"What we do is work on that budget by an aggressive program, not a painful program, so that we can start borrowing less money and getting more investment money on the street through entrepreneurs who can build factories, who will hire people, and maybe we'll start manufacturing goods here in this country again.",1.0
That's -- that's my answer.,0.0
Okay.,0.0
Bill Clinton's top priority is putting America back to work.,1.0
"Bill Clinton and I will create good, high-wage jobs for our people, the same way he has done in his state.",0.0
"Bill Clinton has created high-wage manufacturing jobs at 10 times the national average and in fact according to the statistics coming from the Bush-Quayle Labor Dept, for the last 2 years in a role Bill Clinton's state has been number one among all 50 in the creation of jobs in the private sector.",0.0
"By contrast, in the nation as a whole, during the last 4 years, it is the first time since the presidency of Herbert Hoover, that we have gone for a 4-year period with fewer jobs at the end of that 4-year period than we had at the beginning.",1.0
And look at manufacturing.,0.0
We have lost 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing under George Bush and Dan Quayle.,0.0
Now don't deny it because 60 Minutes and Nightline and the nation's newspapers have investigated this very carefully.,0.0
When are you going to stop using our tax dollars to shut down American factories and move 'em to foreign countries and throw Americans out of work?,0.0
"Senator, don't always believe what you see on television.",0.0
Let me tell you: the media have been wrong before.,0.0
"You know full well the Caribbean Basin Initiative, you've supported that.",0.0
No.,0.0
"Our people will be glad to furnish the press, if they're interested, in Senator Gore's voting record on the Caribbean Basin Initiative.",1.0
"But let's talk -- you know, you keep talking about trickle-down economics and all this stuff, about the worst economy since Hoover.",1.0
It is a bad economy.,1.0
It's a tough economy.,1.0
The question isn't -- it's not who you're going to blame; itâ€™s what are you going to do about it?,0.0
To raise $220 billion in new spending.,0.0
How is raising taxes going to help small business?,0.0
How is raising taxes going to help the farmer?,0.0
How is raising taxes going to help the consumer in America?,0.0
"I submit to you that raising taxes will make matters much, much worse.",0.0
"Well, we've got to re -- we've got to clean out the barn, if I may quote my boss, and start getting this investment money on the street so we can get, and encourage entrepreneurs to build factories.",1.0
We -- the program is out there.,0.0
"It's a put-together thing that requires some sacrifice, but not excessive, and we are willing to move forward in -- on a 5-year clip to put us back where we can start over and get -- get this nation straightened out.",0.0
"Well, the difference between the Perot- Stockdale plan and the Clinton-Gore plan is that Ross Perot's plan concentrates almost exclusively on balancing the budget and reducing the budget deficit, and the danger is that if that is the only goal it could throw our nation back into an even worse recession.",0.0
"Bill Clinton and I have a detailed 5-year budget plan to create good jobs, cut the budget deficit in half, and eliminate the investment deficit in order to get our economy moving forward again.",0.0
"We have a $20-billion infrastructure fund to create a nationwide network of high-speed rail, for example, and what are called information superhighways to open up a whole universe of knowledge for our young people and to help our universities and companies that rely on new advances in the information revolution.",0.0
"We also have tax incentives for investment in job-creating activities, not the kind of encouragement for short-term rip-offs like the proposal that we have had from George Bush.",0.0
When are you going to stop that program?,0.0
We do not have any program that encourages companies to close down here and to go and invest on foreign soil.,0.0
That is absolutely outrageous.,1.0
Of course American businesses do have business abroad; we've got global competition.,0.0
We want businesses to expand.,0.0
"Do you realize this, Senator, that every job that's overseas there's 3 jobs back here to support that.",0.0
"But never have we ever, nor would we, support the idea of someone closing down a factory here and moving overseas.",0.0
That's just totally ridiculous.,1.0
"It's going on right now; it happened in Tennessee, in Decaturville, Tennessee.",0.0
Let me tell you what they're feeling.,0.0
Some of them are in their 50s and 60s.,0.0
They want to know where they're going to get new jobs when their jobs have been destroyed.,0.0
And there are 1.4 million manufacturing jobs that have been lost because of the policies of you and George Bush.,0.0
Do you seriously believe that we ought to continue the same policies that have created the worst economy since the Great Depression?,0.0
I hope that when you talked to those people you said: and the first thing that Bill Clinton and I are going to do is to raise $150 billion in new taxes.,0.0
"You got that wrong, too.",0.0
"Well, you're going to disavow your plan.",0.0
You're pulling a Clinton.,0.0
(Laughter)  And you know what a Clinton is?,0.0
And you know what Clinton is?,0.0
"A Clinton is, is what he says -- he says one thing one day and another thing the next day -- you try to have both sides of the issues.",0.0
The fact of the matter is that you are proposing $150 billion in new taxes.,0.0
"I'm sure what you didn't talk to them about was about how we're going to reform the health care system, like the president wants to do.",0.0
He wants to go out and to reform the health care system so that every American will have available to them affordable health insurance.,0.0
"I'm sure one other thing that you didn't talk to them about, Senator, and that is legal reform, because your position on legal reform is the status quo.",0.0
And yet you talk about foreign competition.,0.0
Why should an American company have to spend 15 to 20 times on product liability and insurance costs compared to a company in Japan or a company in Germany or somewhere else?,0.0
That's not right.,0.0
We have product liability reform legislation on Capitol Hill.,0.0
Bill Clinton and I support a strong national defense.,0.0
He and I have both fought for change within the Democratic Party as well as within the country.,0.0
"In the aftermath of the Cold War, the definition of strong national defense has obviously changed somewhat.",0.0
"For example, George Bush wants to maintain at least 150,000 American soldiers in Europe, even though World War II ended 50 years ago.",0.0
"We believe that we can make savings in our defense budget and at the same time, improve our national security.",0.0
"Now, for those who are affected by the cutbacks, whether they come from George Bush or Bill Clinton and me -- the difference is, Bill Clinton and I have a defense conversion program so that those who won the Cold War will not be left out in the cold.",0.0
"We want to put them to work, building an infrastructure and an economy here in this country for the '90's and the next century.",0.0
We won the Cold War because we invested in national security.,1.0
We won the Cold War because we invested in our military.,1.0
We won the Cold War because America had the political will and made the right decisions.,1.0
"Yes, we can make the cuts in defense and we have.",0.0
Bill Clinton wants to cut defense another $60 billion.,0.0
"I'd say to the defense workers in California and elsewhere, a $60 billion defense cut is going to cut a lot of jobs out.",0.0
"Yes, we are making a conversion and we can go to a civil space rather than having defense -- or the defense industry.",0.0
"Well, let me say this: we would not have won the Cold War if we had listened to Senator Gore and his crowd, and had supported a nuclear freeze.",0.0
"If you would have supported that attitude -- if you would have supported that attitude, we would not have won the Cold War.",0.0
We won the Cold War because we invested and we went forward.,1.0
"The numbers, in terms of the dollar cuts, as they stand on our plans now, show us almost the same as the vice president's.",0.0
But we'd note that Mr. -- Governor Clinton's plan is almost twice as much a cut as either one of us.,0.0
"I've been through the end of World War II, and the surprise beginning of Korea, to see how we -- it cost us more money because we overcut the defense budget in the first place.",0.0
"Now there's other differences between the Perot approach and what we see up here on either side of me, and that has to do with we want to focus our interests, economic and military, more to the Pacific.",0.0
We figure that we are generally going along with any sort of a troop removal from Europe.,0.0
So that's still another face of this puzzle.,0.0
"Yeah, I'd like to respond first to you, Admiral Stockdale.",0.0
"Under the details of our 5-year budget plan, we do propose more in defense cuts than George Bush and Dan Quayle, but only 5 % more.",0.0
"-- the military portions of our plan, even though he was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs under George Bush, and John White has endorsed the economic aspects of our plan, even though I believe he was the architect of Ross Perot's economic plan.",1.0
"Now when I heard George Bush say at the convention in Houston, that when he heard the phrase ""we won the Cold War,"" it made him wonder who the ""we"" was.",1.0
"This wasn't a partisan victory that came suddenly, a few months after you took the oath of office.",0.0
This started with Harry Truman and it was a bipartisan effort from the very beginning.,0.0
George Bush taking credit for the Berlin Wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise.,0.0
"And I want to, I want to add -- I want to add one other thing, because in the debate a few nights ago, I think President Bush made a very serious misstatement of fact in response to Ross Perot.",0.0
"It was kind of a little lecture he gave to Ross Perot when he said those SS-18s are gone, Ross, that's done.",0.0
He -- he reached a deal with Boris Yeltsin to completely remove them so we can all sleep safely without any fear tonight.,0.0
But you know what?,0.0
"They thought they were going to get that deal, but when he took the person in charge of the negotiations out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the reelection campaign, the deal unraveled and now there is no START II deal at all.",0.0
In fact there are serious problems.,0.0
"Isn't it a fact, Dan, that every single one of those SS-18s is still there, in the silos, and under the START I treaty, only half of the silos are supposed to be dismantled, and there is no deal to get rid of the other half?",0.0
Didn't the president make a mistake there?,0.0
The president does have a commitment from Boris Yeltsin to eliminate the SS-18s.,0.0
It is a commitment.,0.0
Oh.,0.0
"Lighten up here, Al.",0.0
Let's talk about getting agreements.,0.0
"He's got to deal with the president of Russia, he's got to deal with the chancellor of Germany, the prime minister of Britain, the president of France, the prime minister of Japan -- he's got to deal with a whole host of leaders around the world.",0.0
"And the leaders sit down and they will negotiate, and they will come to agreements with people that they trust.",0.0
"And this is a fundamental problem with Bill Clinton, is trust and character.",0.0
It is not the issue of how he avoided military service 20-some years ago; it's the fact -- it's the fact that he does not tell the truth about it.,0.0
"He first said he didn't get an induction notice, then we find out that he did; he said he didn't have an ROTC slot, then we find out he did; he said he didn't use Senator Fulbright's office for special influence, then we find out that he did.",0.0
These are inconsistencies.,0.0
Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.,1.0
"I want to respond to that, I want to respond to that.",0.0
"George Bush, in case you've forgotten, Dan, said ""Read my lips -- no new taxes.""",0.0
I didn't think I was going to hear that tonight.,0.0
"Hold on, hold on, let me finish.",0.0
He also said he wanted to be the environmental president; then he went on to say he wanted to be the education president.,0.0
"Then he said that he wouldn't raise taxes again -- no, never, ever, ever.",0.0
"Then the next day his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, came out and said that's not a pledge.",0.0
"Then 2 weeks ago he said that after the election, if you win, then James Baker's going to go back to be secretary of state; then a week later, in the debate a few nights ago, he said, no, after the election, if we win, James Baker is going to be in charge of domestic policy.",0.0
"Which is it, Dan?",0.0
Is he going to -- what's your role in this going to be?,0.0
Bill Clinton and I support the right of a woman to choose.,0.0
"And the way to reduce them is by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, not vetoing family planning legislation the way George Bush has consistently done.",1.0
The reason we are pro-choice and in favor of a woman's right to privacy is because we believe that during the early stages of a pregnancy the government has no business coming in and ordering a woman to do what the government thinks is best.,0.0
What Dan Quayle and George Bush and Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson think is the right decision in a given set of circumstances is their privilege -- but don't have the government order a woman to do what they think is the right thing to do.,0.0
We ought to be able to build more common ground among those who describe themselves as pro-choice and pro-life in efforts to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.,0.0
"But, Dan, you can clear this up very simply by repeating after me: I support the right of a woman to choose.",0.0
Can you say that?,0.0
This issue is an issue that divides Americans deeply.,1.0
I happen to be pro-life.,0.0
My objective and the president's objective is to try to reduce abortions in this country.,0.0
We have 1.6 million abortions.,0.0
"We have more abortions in Washington, DC, than we do live births.",0.0
Why shouldn't we have more reflection upon the issue before abor -- the decision of abortion is made.,0.0
I would hope that we would agree upon that.,0.0
"Something like a 24-hour waiting period, parental notification.",0.0
I was in Los Angeles recently and I talked to a woman who told me that she had an abortion when she was 17 years of age.,1.0
And looking back on that she said it was a mistake.,1.0
"She said -- she said I wished at that time, that I was going through this difficult time, that I had counseling to talk about the post-abortion trauma, and talk about adoption rather than abortion.",0.0
"Because if I had had that discussion, I would have had the child.",0.0
Let's not forget that every abortion stops a beating heart.,0.0
"I believe that a woman owns her body and what she does with it is her own business, period.",0.0
Period.,0.0
"I don't -- I, too, abhor abortions, but I don't think they should be made illegal, and I don't -- and I don't think it's a political issue.",0.0
I think it's a privacy issue.,0.0
"Well, you notice in his response, that Dan did not say I support the right of a woman to choose.",0.0
"That is because he and George Bush have turned over their party to Pat Buchanan and Phyllis Schlafly, who have ordered them to endorse a platform which makes all abortions illegal under any circumstances, regardless of what has led to that decision by a woman.",0.0
"Even in cases of rape and incest, their platform requires that a woman be penalized, that she not be allowed to make a choice, if she believes, in consultation with her family, her doctor, and others, whoever she chooses, that she wants to have an abortion after rape, or incest.",0.0
-- illegal under any of those circumstances.,0.0
Now -- now you want to waffle around on it and give the impression that maybe you don't really mean what you say.,0.0
"But again, you can clear it up by simply repeating I support the right of a woman to choose.",0.0
Say it.,0.0
Talk about waffling around.,0.0
This issue is a very important issue.,0.0
"It has been debated throughout your public life and throughout my public life, and one thing that I don't think that it is wise to do, and that is to change your position.",0.0
"At one time, and most of the time in the House of Representatives, you had a pro-life position.",0.0
That's simply not true.,0.0
You wrote a letter saying that you oppose taxpayer funding of abortion.,1.0
Bill Clinton has the same type of a record.,1.0
In some circumstances.,0.0
And I still do.,0.0
"And Bill Clinton, when he was governor of Arkansas, also worked with the Right to Life people and supported Right to Life positions and now he has changed.",0.0
This is the typical type of Clinton response.,0.0
Even on the issue like abortion.,0.0
He's on both sides of the issue.,0.0
How long did he have to wait -- or how quickly did he change his position on education?,0.0
He changes his position all the time.,0.0
Let's stay with this issue for a while.,0.0
Bill Clinton -- Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.,1.0
3 words he fears most in the English language.,1.0
Tell the truth.,0.0
"Yeah, I want to talk about this, because the question was not about free trade or education.",0.0
-- issue of waffling.,0.0
He's waffled on the abortion issue.,0.0
Let me talk now.,0.0
"It's going to be a long evening if you're like this, now.",0.0
On the 24 hour waiting period -- do you support that?,0.0
I have had the same position on abortion in favor of a woman's right to choose.,0.0
-- the question.,0.0
"Now, wait a minute.",0.0
Let me tell you why this is so important.,0.0
There are millions of women in this country who passionately believe in the right of a woman to privacy.,0.0
And they want to stack the Supreme Court with justices who will take away the right to privacy.,0.0
Make no mistake about it.,0.0
I agree with Admiral Stockdale and the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans in this country.,0.0
"You know, one of the reasons so many Republicans are supporting the Clinton- Gore ticket is because they've turned over the party to this right wing extremist group which takes positions on issues like abortion that don't even allow exceptions for rape and incest.",1.0
"I would like to get in -- I feel like I'm an observer at a pingpong game, where they're talking about well, you know, they're expert professional politicians that massage these intricate plots and know every nuance to 'em.",0.0
"And meantime, we're facing a desperate situation in our economy.",0.0
I've seen the cost of living double in my lifetime.,0.0
A new granddaughter was born in my family -- my granddaughter- -3 weeks ago.,0.0
"And according to the statistics that we have -- that is, the Perot group -- the chances of her seeing a doubling of the standard of living are nil.",0.0
"In fact, her children will be dead before another -- this standard of living is doubled.",0.0
So what the heck!,0.0
Let's get on with talking about something substantive.,0.0
Just 15 seconds to respond.,0.0
"Well, can I have 15 seconds also?",0.0
I'll tell you what.,0.0
Do you support that?,0.0
"You know, I didn't have my hearing aid turned on.",0.0
Tell me again.,0.0
"Nasty attacks -- well, I think there is a case to be made for putting emphasis on character over these issues that we've been batting back and forth and have a life of their own.",0.0
"Sure, you have to know where you're going with your government, but character is the big variable in the success.",0.0
Character of the leaders is the big variable in the success -- long term success -- of an administration.,0.0
"I went to a friend of mine in New York some years ago and he was a president of a major TV network and he said, you know, I think we have messed up this whole -- this election process -- it was an election year -- by stressing that -- putting out the dogma that issues are the thing to talk about, not character.",0.0
"He said, I felt so strongly about this, I went back and read the Lincoln-Douglas debates.",0.0
Read those debates.,0.0
How do they come down?,0.0
Douglas is all character.,0.0
He knows all of the little stinky numbers these guys do.,1.0
Abraham Lincoln had character.,0.0
Thank God we got the right president in the Civil War.,0.0
"But that is a question that is a valid one, and you know, I would like to brag about the character of my boss.",0.0
"This election is about the future of our country, not about personal attacks against one candidate or another.",1.0
"Our nation is in trouble and it is appalling to me that with 10 million Americans out work, with the rest working harder for less money than they did 4 years ago, with the loss of 1.4 million manufacturing jobs in our nation, with the health care crisis, a crisis of crime and drugs and AIDS, substandard education, that George Bush would constantly try to level personal attacks at his opponent.",0.0
"Now, this, of course, just reached a new low last week when he resorted to a classic McCarthyite technique of trying to smear Bill Clinton over a trip that he took as a student along with lots of other Rhodes Scholars who were invited to go to Russia.",0.0
It's a classic McCarthyite smear technique.,0.0
I think that he insulted the intelligence of the American people and I'm awful proud that the American people rejected that tactic so overwhelmingly that he decided he had made a mistake.,1.0
"Do you think it was a mistake, too, Dan?",0.0
Let me answer the question.,0.0
"Hal, you said -- and I wrote it down here -- ""personal negative attacks.""",0.0
(Laughs) Has anyone been reading my press clippings for the last 4 years?,0.0
And is it a negative attack and a personal attack to point out that Bill Clinton simply has trouble telling the truth?,1.0
He said that he didn't even demonstrate -- he told the people in Arkansas in 1978.,0.0
Then we find out he organized demonstrations.,0.0
"You know, I don't care whether he demonstrated or didn't demonstrate.",0.0
"The fact -- the question is, tell the truth.",0.0
Just tell us the truth.,0.0
"Today, Bill Clinton -- excuse me -- yesterday in Philadelphia on a radio show, just yesterday on a radio show, he attacked -- Admiral, he attacks Ross Perot saying the media is giving Ross Perot a free ride.",0.0
"The press asked him when the klieg lights are on, said what do you mean by Ross Perot getting a free ride?",0.0
He says I didn't say that at all.,0.0
"I mean, you can't have it both ways.",0.0
"No, I don't think that is a personal attack.",0.0
What I find troubling with Bill Clinton is he can't tell the truth.,0.0
You cannot lead this great country of ours by misleading the people.,0.0
I think the best justification for getting Ross Perot in the race again to stay is that we're seeing this kind of chit-chat back and forth about issues that don't concentrate on where our grandchildren -- the living standards of our children and grandchildren.,0.0
"He is, as I have read in more than one article, a revolutionary; he's got plans out there that are going to double the speed at which this budget problem is being cared for.",0.0
"It was asked how, if we would squeeze down so fast that we would strangle the economy in the process.",0.0
"That is an art, to follow all those variables and know when to let up and to nurse this economy back together with pulls and pushes.",0.0
"And there's no better man in the world to do that than that old artist, Ross Perot.",0.0
And so I think that my closing statement is that I think I'm in a room with people that aren't the life of reality.,0.0
"Three weeks from today, our nation will make a fateful decision.",1.0
"We can continue traveling the road we have been on, which has led to higher unemployment and worse economic times, or we can reach out for change.",0.0
"If we choose change, it will require us to reach down inside ourselves to find the courage to take a new direction.",0.0
Sometimes it seems deceptively easy to continue with the old habits even when they're no longer good for us.,0.0
Trickle-down economics simply does not work.,0.0
We have had an increase in all of the things that should be decreasing.,0.0
Everything that should have been increasing has been going down.,0.0
We have got to change direction.,0.0
Bill Clinton offers a new approach.,0.0
"He's moved 17,000 people off the welfare rolls and on to payrolls.",0.0
"He has introduced innovations in health care and education, and again, he has led the nation for the last 2 years in a row in the creation of jobs in the private sector.",0.0
"Isn't it time for a new approach, a new generation of ideas and leadership, to put our nation's people first and to get our economy moving again?",0.0
We simply cannot stand to continue with this failed approach that is no good for us.,0.0
"Ultimately, it is a choice between hope and fear, a choice between the future and the past.",0.0
It is time to reach out for a better nation.,0.0
"We are bigger than George Bush has told us we are, as a nation, and we have a much brighter future.",0.0
Give us a chance.,1.0
"With your help, we'll change this country and we can't wait to get started.",1.0
"Thank you, Hal.",0.0
I'd like to use this closing statement to talk to you about a few people that I have met in these last 4 years.,0.0
I think of a woman in Chicago when I was talking to parents about education where she stood up and said I'm sick and tired of these schools in this city being nothing but a factory for failure.,1.0
And that's why we support choice in education.,0.0
"I was in Beaumont, Texas, and met with small business people, and they wanted to reform the civil justice system because they think our legal system costs too much and there's too much of a delay in getting an answer.",0.0
"I was in Middletown, Ohio, talking to a welfare woman, where she said I want to go back to work and I had a job offered to me but I'm not going to take it because I have 2 children at home and the job that is offered to me doesn't have health insurance.",0.0
"Under President Bush's health care reform package that woman won't have to make a choice about going back to work or health care for her children, because she'll have both.",0.0
"I was in Vilnius, Lithuania, Independence Square, speaking to 10,000 people in the middle of winter.",0.0
Hundreds of people came up to me and said: God bless America.,0.0
"Yes, in the next 4 years, as I said, somewhere, some time, there's going to be a crisis, and you need to have a president that is qualified, has the experience, and has been tested.",0.0
"Not one time during this evening, during 90 minutes, did Al Gore tell us why Bill Clinton is qualified to be president.",0.0
He never answered my charges that Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.,0.0
The American people should demand that their president tell the truth.,0.0
Do you really believe -- do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth?,0.0
"In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free.",0.0
"In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.",0.0
"I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.",1.0
"We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival.",0.0
"Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.",0.0
The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.,0.0
But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.,1.0
"The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.",1.0
"If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.",0.0
"If we fail, then freedom fails.",0.0
"Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?",0.0
Are we as strong as we should be?,0.0
"Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?",0.0
"I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.",1.0
"This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country.",1.0
I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.,0.0
Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.,0.0
"I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.",1.0
"I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.",1.0
I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.,0.0
"I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.",0.0
I think we should have an educational system second to none.,0.0
I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free.,0.0
I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.,0.0
"Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are.",0.0
"These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.",0.0
I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.,0.0
If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby.,0.0
He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.,0.0
"He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house.",0.0
He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.,0.0
I think we can do better.,0.0
I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.,0.0
I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.,0.0
I don't at all.,0.0
I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.,0.0
And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.,0.0
But I think there is also a national responsibility.,0.0
The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.,0.0
The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have.,0.0
"A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.",0.0
"Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.",0.0
"I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.",0.0
And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.,1.0
It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.,0.0
I think we can do a better job.,0.0
I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.,0.0
We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.,0.0
"If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.",0.0
And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.,0.0
The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.,0.0
Because they felt that the American society was moving again.,0.0
I want us to recapture that image.,0.0
"I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.",1.0
That is the obligation upon our generation.,0.0
I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.,0.0
I think it can be.,0.0
And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.,0.0
I think it's time America started moving again.,0.0
"Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy.",0.0
The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.,0.0
There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.,0.0
"There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.",1.0
"We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.",0.0
"But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.",0.0
"And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.",0.0
"Where, then, do we disagree?",0.0
I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.,0.0
"We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.",0.0
"Now last year, of course, was 1958.",0.0
That happened to be a recession year.,0.0
More about that later.,0.0
"Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.",1.0
Is the United States standing still?,0.0
"Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?",1.0
"Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.",0.0
"Well, we have a comparison that we can make.",0.0
We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.,0.0
"When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.",0.0
Let's take schools.,0.0
"We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.",0.0
Let's take hydroelectric power.,0.0
We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.,0.0
Let us take hospitals.,0.0
We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.,0.0
The same is true of highways.,0.0
Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.,0.0
We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen percent over seven years.,0.0
That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.,1.0
But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.,0.0
What has happened to you?,0.0
We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.,1.0
What about the prices you pay?,0.0
We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.,1.0
What's the net result of this?,0.0
"Now, this is not standing still.",0.0
"But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.",0.0
A record is never something to stand on.,0.0
It's something to build on.,0.0
"And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.",0.0
"And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.",0.0
Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way.,0.0
I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.,0.0
"But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.",0.0
What kind of programs are we for?,0.0
"We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.",0.0
"We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time.",0.0
"Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.",0.0
We both want to help the old people.,0.0
We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.,0.0
The question is the means.,0.0
I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.,0.0
"I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.",1.0
"Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.",0.0
I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.,0.0
I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.,0.0
Now the Republican platform will cost more too.,0.0
"Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?",0.0
Not at all.,0.0
Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.,0.0
It is a question of which administration does the right thing.,0.0
"And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.",0.0
"I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.",1.0
"The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.",0.0
Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.,0.0
I know what it means to be poor.,1.0
I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.,1.0
"I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",0.0
It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.,0.0
I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.,0.0
"First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.",0.0
"For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.",0.0
"After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.",0.0
"Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.",0.0
"Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.",0.0
I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.,0.0
I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.,1.0
In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.,0.0
"In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.",0.0
I think it's true of Latin America also.,0.0
"We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.",0.0
"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.",1.0
The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.,0.0
There are hundreds of thousands of them.,0.0
They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.,0.0
"They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.",0.0
They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.,0.0
I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.,0.0
"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",1.0
The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.,0.0
The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.,0.0
"So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.",1.0
So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.,0.0
"Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.",0.0
"The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.",0.0
We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.,0.0
I think that this farm policy has failed.,0.0
In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.,0.0
And that can only be done through governmental action.,0.0
"I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six percent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.",0.0
I think Mr.Benson's program has failed.,0.0
"And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.",0.0
I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.,0.0
"I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.",0.0
I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.,0.0
I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.,0.0
"He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.",0.0
I think this is the wrong direction.,0.0
I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.,0.0
The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.,0.0
It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.,0.0
And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.,0.0
The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.,0.0
"Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.",0.0
"Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.",0.0
"But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.",0.0
"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.",0.0
"Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.",0.0
The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.,0.0
"Now, I can only say this.",0.0
Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.,0.0
I have been in the cabinet.,0.0
I have met with the legislative leaders.,0.0
"I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.",0.0
The President has asked for my advice.,0.0
I have given it.,0.0
Sometimes my advice has been taken.,0.0
Sometimes it has not.,0.0
I do not say that I have made the decisions.,0.0
"And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.",0.0
All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.,0.0
"As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.",0.0
Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.,0.0
"As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.",0.0
His experience has been different from mine.,0.0
Mine has been in the executive branch.,0.0
His has been in the legislative branch.,0.0
I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.,1.0
"Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.",0.0
Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.,0.0
There's no certain road to the presidency.,0.0
There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.,0.0
The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?,0.0
I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.,0.0
"Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.",0.0
"Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?",0.0
Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?,0.0
Why do I take it now?,0.0
"We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.",0.0
We need higher teachers' salaries.,0.0
But we also want our education to be free of federal control.,0.0
"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.",1.0
I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.,1.0
There is another point that should be made.,0.0
I favor higher salaries for teachers.,1.0
"But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.",0.0
"I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.",0.0
"I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.",0.0
This is not enough; it should be more.,0.0
But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.,0.0
My objection here is not the cost in dollars.,0.0
"My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.",0.0
"When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.",0.0
The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.,0.0
The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.,0.0
On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.,0.0
"I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.",0.0
And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.,0.0
"Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.",0.0
"That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.",0.0
That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.,0.0
My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.,0.0
It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.,0.0
We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.,1.0
All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.,0.0
"Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.",0.0
It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.,0.0
It was killed in the Rules Committee.,1.0
And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.,0.0
Four Democrats voted for it.,0.0
Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.,0.0
"Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.",0.0
We wanted to tie it to Social Security.,0.0
We offered an amendment to do so.,0.0
"Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.",0.0
And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.,0.0
"In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.",0.0
"But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.",0.0
Well obviously my views are a little different.,0.0
"First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.",0.0
"I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.",0.0
It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.,0.0
I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.,0.0
"When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.",0.0
Because let's consider it.,0.0
If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?,0.0
The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.,1.0
It was because they were too extreme.,0.0
"And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",0.0
"I would say this: that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.",0.0
"Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.",0.0
"We cannot, of course, control the Senate.",0.0
"I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.",0.0
Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.,0.0
It isn't really that.,0.0
"Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.",0.0
"And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.",0.0
"Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.",0.0
You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.,1.0
"And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.",1.0
"Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.",0.0
I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.,0.0
Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.,0.0
"The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.",0.0
"It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.",0.0
I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.,0.0
But I do say a majority are.,0.0
And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.,0.0
"The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.",0.0
It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.,0.0
"The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.",0.0
So these are three programs which are quite moderate.,0.0
I think it shows the difference between the two parties.,0.0
One party is ready to move in these programs.,0.0
The other party gives them lip service.,0.0
"No, and here's why.",0.0
And I'll tell you exactly why.,0.0
Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.,0.0
I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.,0.0
I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.,0.0
"So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.",0.0
"I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.",1.0
If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.,0.0
"But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.",0.0
"Let me also say, we're having an election today.",0.0
You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.,0.0
"Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.",0.0
"You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little.",0.0
I think they're taxed too much.,0.0
I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.,0.0
I said that wasn't the right thing to do.,0.0
"Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.",0.0
I don't believe that's the way to do it.,0.0
Here's some thing that'll help.,0.0
Give us a balanced budget amendment.,0.0
"He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.",0.0
Have to do it.,0.0
I'd like the government to have that.,0.0
"And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.",0.0
"I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.",1.0
I've proposed another one.,0.0
Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.,0.0
I think it's good.,0.0
It's a check- off.,0.0
It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.,0.0
"You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.",0.0
"And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.",0.0
You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.,0.0
"I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't.",0.0
That's the main growing thing in the budget.,0.0
"The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.",0.0
"We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.",0.0
I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.,0.0
"Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman.",0.0
"I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.",0.0
This situation got so bad that I decided I'd better get into it.,0.0
The American people asked me to get into it.,0.0
But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.,0.0
"Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.",0.0
And what I'm looking for is who did it?,0.0
"Now, they're the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it.",0.0
"Now, the facts are we have to fix it.",0.0
I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.,0.0
"When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers.",0.0
Young people with high grades can't get a job.,0.0
People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.,0.0
"In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.",0.0
Now that's up to 40%.,0.0
And what's happened in the meantime?,0.0
The dollar's gone through the floor.,0.0
"Now, whose fault is that?",0.0
Not the Democrats.,0.0
Not the Republicans.,0.0
"Somewhere out there there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess.",0.0
And everybody says they take responsibility.,0.0
Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this.,0.0
"Put it to you bluntly, American people.",0.0
"If you want me to be your president, we're going to face our problems.",0.0
We'll down our debt.,0.0
"We'll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today.",0.0
When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living.,0.0
Today it will take 12 generations.,0.0
Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us.,1.0
"No, I don't have an answer for everything.",0.0
"As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.",0.0
"And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.",0.0
"We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.",0.0
"-- I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more.",1.0
"And I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling, let's get off personalities and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people.",1.0
"I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.",0.0
"Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.",0.0
I think you have to look at it.,0.0
I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.,0.0
It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.,0.0
And everything in there says what I am for.,0.0
"Now I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.",0.0
"My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I've been president for 4 years, so I feel I've been talking issues.",0.0
"You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.",1.0
But character is an important part of the equation.,0.0
The other night Governor Clinton raised my -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night.,0.0
"Well, he raised the question of my father -- it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered.",0.0
"But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism.",0.0
"I remember something my dad told me -- I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother -- which I faithfully did; he said serve your country -- my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth.",0.0
"And I've tried to do that in public life, all through it.",0.0
That says something about character.,0.0
"My argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it's fair to put it in focus is -- I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country's at war.",1.0
Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me.,0.0
But that's what I feel.,0.0
That's what I feel passionately about.,0.0
I'm thinking of Ross Perot's running mate sitting in the jail.,0.0
How would he feel about it?,0.0
But maybe that's generational.,0.0
I don't know.,0.0
But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling.,1.0
And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.,1.0
I started doing these formats a year ago in New Hampshire and I found that we had huge crowds because all I did was let people ask questions and I tried to give very specific answers.,0.0
I also had a program starting last year.,0.0
I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.,1.0
Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.,0.0
Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.,0.0
"When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.",0.0
He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.,0.0
"So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.",0.0
We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.,0.0
"But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote ""political chameleon"" for changing his positions of all times.",1.0
Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.,0.0
Here's my point.,0.0
I'm not interested in his character.,0.0
I want to change the character of the presidency.,0.0
And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.,1.0
So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.,1.0
Let's do it.,0.0
Let's talk about programs for children.,0.0
I think it depends how you define it.,0.0
"I mean, I think in general, let's talk about these issues.",0.0
Let's talk about the programs.,0.0
"But in the presidency, a lot goes into it.",0.0
Caring goes into it.,0.0
That's not particularly specific.,0.0
Strength goes into it.,0.0
That's not specific.,0.0
Standing up against aggression.,0.0
That's not specific in terms of a program.,0.0
This is what a president has to do.,0.0
"So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.",0.0
Ross had his hand up.,0.0
"Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts.",0.0
I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.,1.0
So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.,0.0
"Now, just for the record, I don't have any spin doctors.",0.0
Probably shows.,0.0
I make those charts you see on television.,0.0
But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.,0.0
"See, what you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you got two other choices, right?",0.0
Wait a minute.,0.0
"I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.",0.0
The ideas I express are mine.,0.0
I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.,0.0
So I don't want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else.,0.0
I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.,0.0
I'm just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day.,0.0
I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.,0.0
May I finish?,0.0
Very briefly?,0.0
And I don't have any foreign money in my campaign.,0.0
I don't have any foreign lobbyists on leave in my campaign.,0.0
I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.,0.0
I take the pledge.,0.0
I've already taken the pledge on cutting the deficit in half.,0.0
I never got to say that.,0.0
I took the pledge we'd cut it out.,0.0
I'll be glad to take a shot at it.,0.0
"I'm not sure that -- and I can understand if you haven't seen this, because there's been a lot of hue and cry.",0.0
We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.,0.0
That happened when I was president.,0.0
"And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.",1.0
"Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.",1.0
But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.,0.0
We hear all the negatives.,0.0
When you're president you expect this.,0.0
Everybody's running against the incumbent.,0.0
They can do better.,0.0
Everyone knows that.,0.0
But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.,0.0
Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.,1.0
"Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city.",0.0
There's a good program.,0.0
And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.,1.0
When we went out to south central in Los Angeles -- some of you may remember the riots there.,0.0
I went out there.,0.0
I went to a boys' club.,0.0
"And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.",0.0
We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.,0.0
But there's going to be a new Congress.,0.0
No one likes gridlock.,0.0
There's going to be a new Congress because the old one -- I don't want to get this man made at me -- but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal.,0.0
"And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.",0.0
Help me pass these programs.,0.0
"Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.",0.0
That's the problem with our system.,0.0
If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.,0.0
That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.,1.0
"And that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year.",1.0
This is not mud slinging.,1.0
This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.,1.0
But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.,0.0
Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.,1.0
I agree with him.,1.0
"I mean, we agree with that.",1.0
And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs.,1.0
"There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs.",1.0
They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail.,0.0
"They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind.",0.0
We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we're going to lose in defense -- if we target it.,0.0
We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.,0.0
First you've got to have money to pay for these things.,0.0
So you've got to create jobs.,0.0
There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.,0.0
"I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.",1.0
I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.,1.0
"But since they're bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn't build some bridges.",0.0
"Now, results is what counts.",0.0
The president can't order Congress around.,0.0
Congress can't order the president around.,0.0
"That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?",0.0
But you have to work together.,0.0
"Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.",0.0
They're Democrats.,0.0
"The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.",0.0
"We didn't fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess.",0.0
That's another story that we're going to pay a big price for right after the election.,0.0
The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.,1.0
These people are hurting in the inner cities.,1.0
"We're shipping the quote, ""low paying jobs"" overseas.",0.0
What are low paying jobs?,0.0
"Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.",0.0
They're tomorrow's industries in the inner cities.,0.0
"Let me say in my case, if I'm out of work, I'll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I'll be happy to make shoes, I'll be happy to make clothing, I'll make sausage.",0.0
You just give me a job.,0.0
Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work.,0.0
"If you ask me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can't.",0.0
I've spent my life creating jobs.,0.0
That's something I know how to do.,0.0
You want jobs in the inner city?,0.0
Do you want jobs in the inner city?,0.0
And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.,0.0
That's the way I would do it.,0.0
"I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.",0.0
I support the right to keep and bear arms.,0.0
"I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both.",0.0
"But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.",0.0
"Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.",0.0
"Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.",0.0
I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.,0.0
We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.,0.0
"The third thing I would say -- it doesn't bear directly on gun control, but it's very important -- we need more police on the street.",0.0
"There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it's a shame it didn't pass, I think it should be made the law -- but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period.",1.0
"I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.",0.0
In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.,0.0
So I know it can work; I've seen it happen.,0.0
I think you put your finger on a major problem.,0.0
"I talk about strengthening the American family and it's very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread.",0.0
It's very hard.,0.0
"I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation -- habeas corpus reform, so you don't have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real.",0.0
"I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.",0.0
I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.,0.0
"Virginia's in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms.",0.0
I am not for national registration of firearms.,0.0
Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime.,1.0
"I am for the right, as the governor says- -I'm a sportsman and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons.",0.0
But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal.,0.0
"I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation.",1.0
We've got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.,0.0
So we've got to get it under control and there's one last point I'd make.,0.0
Drugs.,0.0
"We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.",0.0
"And we're making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction.",0.0
We're not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users.,0.0
"The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.",0.0
"So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.",0.0
"On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.",0.0
"I don't care what it is -- competitiveness, health care, crime, you name it.",0.0
"Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it.",0.0
So why pass a law that won't fix it?,0.0
"Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.",0.0
And in our country we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately.,1.0
That's where we are.,0.0
We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require.,0.0
"Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.",1.0
"And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.",0.0
"And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.",0.0
But don't just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing.,1.0
Any order?,0.0
I'll be glad to respond.,0.0
"I believe it would return the government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about.",0.0
"The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years.",0.0
What's wrong with limiting the terms of members of Congress to 12?,0.0
Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.,0.0
"For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.",1.0
We've got to do something about it.,0.0
"And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long.",1.0
"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.",1.0
And how to get them passed?,0.0
Send us some people that will pass the idea.,0.0
And I think you will.,0.0
I think the American people want it now.,1.0
"Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done.",1.0
"Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.",0.0
"I know they're popular, but I'm against them.",0.0
I'll tell you why.,0.0
"I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard.",0.0
"Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already.",0.0
"I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you're going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise.",0.0
"Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can.",0.0
You're going to have 120 to 150 new members of Congress.,0.0
"Now, let me tell you what I favor instead.",0.0
"I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.",0.0
"If you did that you could take away the incumbents' advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight.",1.0
"So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.",0.0
Yes.,0.0
Let me do first on a personal level.,0.0
"If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.",0.0
I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about re-election.,0.0
"And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant.",0.0
"Now, I have set as strong an example as I can, then at that point when we sit down over at Capitol Hill -- tomorrow night I'm going to be talking about government reform -- it's a long subject, you wouldn't let me finish tonight.",0.0
"If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.",0.0
But we have got to reform government.,0.0
"If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.",0.0
It takes both.,0.0
So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.,0.0
"And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.",0.0
"They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.",0.0
"I don't think there are any villains, but, boy, is the system rotten.",1.0
"I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.",1.0
So let me try to answer you in this way.,0.0
Let's start with a premise.,0.0
"We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.",0.0
We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.,0.0
"So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.",0.0
"Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation.",0.0
May I answer that?,0.0
Who do you want to start with?,0.0
That's how much I care about it.,0.0
"And believe me, if you knew my family and if you knew the private life I have, you would agree in a minute that that's a whole lot more fun than getting involved in politics.",0.0
But I have lived the American dream.,0.0
I came from very modest background.,0.0
"Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.",1.0
But I want all the children -- I want these young people up here to be able to start with nothing but an idea like I did and build a business.,0.0
"But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.",0.0
"I just figure, as lucky as I've been, I owe it to them and I owe it to the future generations and on a very personal basis, I owe it to my children and grandchildren.",0.0
"Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.",0.0
I'm sure it has.,0.0
I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.,0.0
I think that that's an important part of being a parent.,0.0
Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?,0.0
I was in the Lomax AME Church.,0.0
"It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.",0.0
I talk to parents.,1.0
"I mean, you've got to care.",1.0
Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.,1.0
"But I don't think it's fair to say, you haven't had cancer.",0.0
But everybody's affected by the debt because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt everything's more expensive.,0.0
Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket.,0.0
So it's that.,0.0
"And that's why I'm trying to do something about it by stimulating the export, vesting more, better education systems.",0.0
Thank you.,0.0
Tell me how it's affected you again.,0.0
"Well, I've been governor of a small state for 12 years.",0.0
I'll tell you how it's affected me.,0.0
Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.,0.0
"I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.",1.0
"I have seen what's happened in this last 4 years when -- in my state, when people lose their jobs there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.",0.0
"When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.",0.0
"When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.",0.0
"And I've been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance.",1.0
What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.,0.0
It is because America has not invested in its people.,0.0
It is because we have not grown.,0.0
It is because we've had 12 years of trickle down economics.,0.0
We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.,0.0
We've had 4 years where we've produced no private sector jobs.,0.0
Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago.,0.0
It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.,0.0
"And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I'm going to go fix it but what are we going to do?",0.0
"I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again.",0.0
"Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund.",0.0
"The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it's projected out to be sound beyond that.",0.0
So at least we have time to work with it.,0.0
"But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.",0.0
Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth.,0.0
I can't give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund.,0.0
All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions.,0.0
And that is very important.,0.0
It's still the most respected credit.,0.0
"So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you're going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund.",0.0
And I think that's the only answer.,0.0
"But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure.",0.0
"One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.",0.0
It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages.,1.0
And it's a big fight.,1.0
And I don't want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through.,0.0
And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.,0.0
You've got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you.,0.0
But that's what the election's about.,0.0
I agree with the governor.,0.0
That's what the election's about.,0.0
"And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned.",0.0
"On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.",0.0
You have a raging debate about those plans.,0.0
"Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.",0.0
"Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs.",0.0
"Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once.",0.0
Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.,0.0
"Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete.",0.0
"Anybody that's ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you've put something into effect.",0.0
The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.,1.0
Everybody knows how to fix them.,0.0
"There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it.",0.0
"Now, back over here.",0.0
"See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.",0.0
"Now, that's another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight.",0.0
You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.,0.0
Why did our government do it?,0.0
To get the interest rates down.,0.0
A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year.,0.0
"Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don't pay for money, you realize there's quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there's going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof.",0.0
"You know, and everybody's ducking it so I'm gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank.",0.0
We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund.,0.0
We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is.,0.0
"Now, that -- put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it's just kind of the way things are.",0.0
"That's because it comes at you, not from you.",0.0
"Now then, that money needs to be -- they don't even pay interest on it.",0.0
They just write a note for the interest.,0.0
Do you want to fix the problem or sound-bite it?,0.0
"I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.",0.0
"Now then, to nail it, there's one way out -- a growing, expanding job base.",0.0
"A growing, expanding job base to generate the funds and the tax revenues to pay off the mess and rebuild America.",0.0
We've got to double-hit.,0.0
"If we're $4 trillion down, we should have everything perfect, but we don't.",0.0
"We've got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it, and that's going to take a growing, expanding job base.",0.0
That is priority one in this country.,0.0
Put everybody that's breathing to work.,0.0
"And I'd love to be out of workers and have to import them, like some of our international competitors.",0.0
Absolutely.,0.0
I apologize.,0.0
All right.,0.0
I think I remember the question.,0.0
"Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy.",0.0
What you have to decide is who's got the best economic plan.,0.0
"And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record.",0.0
So I don't want you to read my lips and I sure don't want you to read his.,0.0
I do hope you will read our plans.,0.0
"Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.",0.0
"There are different ideas -- the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton -- we have different ideas.",0.0
"I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.",0.0
You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.,0.0
"Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.",0.0
Social Security is in surplus $70 billion.,0.0
"Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.",0.0
What do we have to do?,0.0
"By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.",0.0
"Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.",0.0
"What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it's not just enough to have the guarantee.",0.0
We had a guarantee -- and what happened?,0.0
You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it.,0.0
So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.,0.0
"Well, we have come to that position.",0.0
"Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.",1.0
This is exciting.,0.0
New world order to me means freedom and democracy.,0.0
"I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved.",0.0
"If we pull back in some isolation and say we don't have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we'll get involved in the future.",0.0
"NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we'll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.",0.0
"But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down.",0.0
And you hear all the bad stuff that's happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind.,0.0
I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.,0.0
"And we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things.",0.0
"You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.",0.0
Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.,1.0
We're doing this all around the world.,1.0
"Yes, we got problems at home.",0.0
And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.,0.0
"But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war.",0.0
"President Reagan said no, peace through strength.",0.0
It worked.,0.0
"The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.",0.0
"So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation.",0.0
"If it hadn't been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he'd have nuclear weapons.",0.0
"Excuse me, Carole.",0.0
"Well, it's cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution; it's pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the Cold War.",0.0
"Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.",1.0
All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.,0.0
"I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us.",0.0
"We've got agreements, but they are still there.",0.0
"With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we've got our work cut out for us.",0.0
So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.,0.0
We have to have money to do that.,0.0
We have to have our people at work.,0.0
"See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army.",0.0
I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.,0.0
We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.,0.0
We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.,0.0
Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece.,0.0
If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.,0.0
Coming out of World War II it made sense.,0.0
"Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.",0.0
I'll close on this point.,0.0
You can't be a superpower unless you're an economic superpower.,0.0
"If we're not an economic superpower, we're a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world.",1.0
And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.,0.0
Because the question you ask is important.,0.0
The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change.,1.0
"Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing.",0.0
And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.,0.0
And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.,0.0
We may differ about what the elements of that are.,0.0
"I think that defense needs to be -- with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people.",0.0
I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.,0.0
Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.,0.0
"Number 2, if you don't rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won't be a superpower.",0.0
We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.,0.0
We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.,0.0
"That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.",0.0
"And number three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy and we need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether it's in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting.",0.0
"We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.",0.0
Okay.,0.0
"Well, I don't have any idea but I hope it will happen some time in my lifetime.",0.0
I believe that this country is electing more and more African Americans and Latinos and Asian Americans who are representing districts that are themselves not necessarily of a majority of their race.,0.0
"The American people are beginning to vote across racial lines, and I hope it will happen more and more.",0.0
More and more women are being elected.,0.0
Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.,0.0
"And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time.",1.0
"This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.",0.0
They know what it's like not to have flexible working hours.,0.0
And I think it will happen in my lifetime.,0.0
I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.,0.0
"Yeah, but wouldn't that suggest to the American people, then, here's a quality person, if he decided that he could automatically get the nomination of either party?",0.0
Huh?,0.0
"You mean, time?",0.0
I don't know -- starting after 4 years.,0.0
I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.,0.0
This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.,0.0
Let's see how they do.,0.0
I have a fearless forecast.,0.0
Right?,0.0
"Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.",0.0
These are people that I just happen to know and have a high regard for.,0.0
I'm sure there are hundreds of others.,0.0
How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?,0.0
"Yeah, a good man.",0.0
"Oh, oh.",0.0
My candidate's back there.,0.0
I can think of many.,0.0
How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?,0.0
National Institutes of Health.,0.0
I'll yield the floor.,0.0
Name some more.,0.0
May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.,0.0
(Applause) But don't take it out of my time!,0.0
I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.,0.0
three ways to do that.,0.0
One is to raise taxes.,0.0
One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.,0.0
Another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth.,0.0
I do not want to raise taxes.,0.0
I differ with the 2 here on that.,0.0
I'm just not going to do that.,0.0
I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.,0.0
I think we need to invest and save more.,0.0
I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.,0.0
I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.,0.0
We've got to strengthen the family.,0.0
"Now, let me pose this question to America.",0.0
"If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis -- there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat -- my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?",0.0
"Who has the perseverance, the character, the integrity, the maturity, to get the job done?",0.0
I hope I'm that person.,0.0
"Thank you very, very much.",0.0
"If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.",0.0
"If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.",0.0
I am results oriented.,0.0
I am action oriented.,0.0
Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do.,0.0
Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.,0.0
"Sure, you can do that with Congress.",0.0
Congress -- they're all good people.,0.0
They're all patriots but you've got to link arms and work with them.,0.0
"Sure, you'll have arguments.",0.0
"Sure, you'll have fights.",0.0
We have them all day every day.,0.0
But we get the job done.,0.0
"Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education.",0.0
I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.,0.0
And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.,0.0
Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.,0.0
Now that will change America.,0.0
Those children will all go to college.,0.0
"And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.",1.0
And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.,0.0
"Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water.",1.0
And we have got to put our nation back to work.,0.0
"Now, if you don't want to really do that I'm not your man.",0.0
I'd go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one.,0.0
"In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.",0.0
"Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess.",0.0
"I've been paying taxes just like you and Lord knows, I've paid my share -- over a billion in taxes.",0.0
But it's in your hands.,0.0
I wish you well.,0.0
"Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.",0.0
Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.,0.0
I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly.,0.0
I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.,0.0
These problems are not easy.,0.0
They're not going to be solved overnight.,0.0
But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things.,0.0
"First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things -- more jobs and better schools.",0.0
Our schools are now better.,0.0
"Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country.",0.0
We talked about that.,0.0
"This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.",0.0
I'm proud of that.,0.0
It happened because I could work with people -- Republicans and Democrats.,1.0
"That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.",1.0
You have to decide whether you want to change or not.,0.0
We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.,0.0
We've had 12 years of trickle down economics.,0.0
"It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.",0.0
I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.,0.0
But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget.,0.0
We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.,0.0
I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.,0.0
We're better than that.,0.0
We can do better than that.,0.0
I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.,0.0
Thank you very much.,0.0
"Thank you, Jim.",0.0
"And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.",0.0
"I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.",0.0
Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration.,0.0
"I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.",0.0
I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives.,0.0
Four years ago you took me on faith.,0.0
"Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.",0.0
We are better off than we were four years ago.,0.0
Let's keep it going.,0.0
We cut the deficit by 60 percent.,0.0
"Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.",0.0
We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.,0.0
"Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.",0.0
We passed family and medical leave.,0.0
Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.,0.0
"We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.",0.0
Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.,0.0
We passed welfare reform.,0.0
Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.,0.0
"And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college.",0.0
We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.,0.0
And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.,0.0
Thank you.,0.0
"Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.",0.0
"Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.",0.0
It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.,0.0
I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.,0.0
"I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.",0.0
I've learned from them that people do have tough times.,0.0
And sometimes you can't go it alone.,0.0
And that's what America is all about.,0.0
I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .,1.0
"And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.",1.0
America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.,1.0
"Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.",0.0
You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.,0.0
"You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education.",0.0
"But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.",0.0
And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.,0.0
"Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.",0.0
"Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.",0.0
And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.,0.0
"It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.",0.0
"Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives.",0.0
"That, to me, is the key.",0.0
And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.,0.0
"For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.",0.0
"We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.",0.0
"But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.",0.0
"All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.",0.0
I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.,0.0
"I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.",0.0
"I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people.",0.0
I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.,0.0
"These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.",0.0
"I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.",0.0
The President trusts the government.,0.0
We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.,0.0
"One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.",0.0
"Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.",0.0
Not just the rich.,0.0
"If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.",0.0
"We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.",0.0
I guess I rely more on the individual.,0.0
I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.,0.0
"Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.",0.0
That's my difference with the President.,0.0
We'll have specific differences later.,0.0
"He noted a few, but there are others.",0.0
I trust the people.,0.0
We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives.,0.0
"But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.",1.0
"I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick.",0.0
Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents.,0.0
But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.,0.0
"Well, he's better off than he was four years ago.",0.0
I agree with that.,0.0
That's right.,0.0
"And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know.",0.0
I looked at the slowest growth in the century.,0.0
"He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.",0.0
We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history.,0.0
We've got stagnant wages.,0.0
"In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.",0.0
"Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.",0.0
So we have stagnation.,0.0
We have the highest foreign debt in history.,0.0
"And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?",0.0
"Well, I guess some may be better off.",0.0
Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.,0.0
Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.,0.0
But are the American people?,0.0
They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes.,1.0
"More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.",0.0
So some may be better off.,0.0
They talk about family income being up.,0.0
"That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.",0.0
And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.,0.0
"One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.",0.0
"We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.",0.0
That's what America is all about.,0.0
"Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.",0.0
"We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.",0.0
Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade.,0.0
We have record numbers of new small businesses.,0.0
We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.,0.0
All groups of people are growing.,0.0
We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.,0.0
The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.,0.0
So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago.,0.0
Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.,0.0
"How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.",0.0
That's what I want to focus on.,0.0
"But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.",0.0
"But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.",0.0
"We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.",1.0
"It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.",0.0
"Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children.",0.0
Are your children getting a better education.,0.0
Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America.,0.0
"Crime has gone down but it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.",0.0
"So, yes, some may be better off.",0.0
"But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.",0.0
Absolutely not.,0.0
Let's look at the position.,0.0
"First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members.",1.0
"He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time.",0.0
That's what he said.,0.0
"Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund.",0.0
It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more.,0.0
"The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.",0.0
"And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.",0.0
"Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.",0.0
And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.,0.0
But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.,1.0
"We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.",0.0
"Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it.",0.0
I thought it was a good program.,0.0
But I've supported Medicare ever since.,0.0
"In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.",1.0
I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.,1.0
"In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House.",1.0
I'm concerned about healthcare.,1.0
"I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.",0.0
"It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke.",1.0
He doesn't fix it for ten years.,0.0
"We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida.",0.0
"And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.",0.0
"Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.",1.0
You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart.,1.0
I think it's time to have a truce.,1.0
"Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission.",0.0
"But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed.",1.0
I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.,0.0
My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.,0.0
"We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.",0.0
But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.,0.0
"Oh, yes.",0.0
And you'll be eligible.,0.0
"And so will the former President, yes.",0.0
I need it.,0.0
"Well, the people need it, that's the point.",0.0
This is not a Wall Street tax cut.,0.0
This is a family tax cut.,0.0
"This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.",0.0
This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.,0.0
"First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.",0.0
"He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.",1.0
It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.,0.0
So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.,0.0
It's a state tax relief.,0.0
It's a $500 per child tax credit.,0.0
It's about litigation reforms.,0.0
"In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.",0.0
And it's also regulatory reform.,0.0
"It's a good package, Mr. President.",0.0
We'd like to have your support.,0.0
"Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.",1.0
"It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.",0.0
It's not good to raise the deficit.,0.0
We worked too hard to lower it.,0.0
"It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.",0.0
"So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that's the right way to go.",0.0
The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years.,0.0
"I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.",0.0
I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.,0.0
"We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people.",0.0
You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.,0.0
"It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.",0.0
"Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.",0.0
The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.,0.0
"Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.",0.0
"Now, let me just give you an example.",0.0
"I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.",1.0
The drunk driver had no money.,1.0
"Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery.",1.0
I thought that was wrong.,1.0
"So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.",0.0
But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.,0.0
I've done a lot of things that were controversial.,0.0
"My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.",0.0
Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.,0.0
That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.,0.0
How does he avoid conflict?,0.0
"Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers.",0.0
"Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn.",0.0
I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.,0.0
"The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.",0.0
We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.,0.0
"But we're lawyers, I like lawyers.",0.0
I don't dislike trial lawyers.,0.0
But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.,0.0
You're putting a lot of business people out of business.,1.0
"I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world.",1.0
"So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.",1.0
"And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.",0.0
And I will address you as Mr. President.,0.0
You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.,0.0
"Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.",0.0
I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.,0.0
"Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.",1.0
"And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws.",1.0
"That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.",1.0
That's not true.,0.0
So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.,0.0
I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.,0.0
I think it's very difficult.,0.0
Let's be honest about it.,0.0
That's why we need campaign finance reform.,0.0
And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.,0.0
"Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform.",0.0
"I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.",0.0
We tried six or eight years ago.,0.0
"He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.",0.0
"We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.",0.0
"You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago.",0.0
We have a commission on campaign finance reform.,0.0
"They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.",0.0
That's how it works.,0.0
"We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.",0.0
But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.,0.0
I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.,0.0
But I want to go back to 1965.,0.0
That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes.,0.0
And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.,0.0
We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.,0.0
All 50 states did it.,0.0
It took three and a half years.,0.0
"It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.",0.0
"What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?",0.0
"Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.",0.0
It seems to me that you have a selective memory.,1.0
"You know, mine doesn't work that way.",0.0
So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.,0.0
But let me respond to what you said.,0.0
I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.,0.0
That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.,0.0
"So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.",1.0
"And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.",1.0
"And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.",0.0
I strongly supported it.,1.0
And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.,1.0
And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.,1.0
"And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.",0.0
"Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.",0.0
Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.,0.0
"Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President.",1.0
Millions and millions of Americans.,1.0
They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.,1.0
They know the Democratic party won't do it.,1.0
We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.,1.0
"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.",0.0
I am.,0.0
But let's look at the overall record.,0.0
"Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.",0.0
"The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.",0.0
Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.,0.0
We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.,0.0
We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.,1.0
"We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.",0.0
And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.,0.0
"Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you.",0.0
Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.,0.0
I think we all do.,0.0
And I hope we can do better.,0.0
I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.,0.0
"I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.",0.0
"You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.",0.0
"I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.",0.0
But it seems to me the record is clear.,0.0
"The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.",0.0
Drug use doubled.,0.0
You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.,1.0
But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.,0.0
You cut interdiction substantially.,0.0
"I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.",0.0
"And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.",0.0
This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.,0.0
And we have a responsibility.,0.0
You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.,0.0
Is that the kind of leadership we need?,0.0
And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.,0.0
"But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.",0.0
"Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.",0.0
That's what I thought we ought to do.,0.0
"Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.",0.0
I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.,0.0
We just have a different approach.,0.0
"But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.",1.0
"I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.",1.0
We need to do this together and we can.,1.0
Not if I didn't have a better idea.,0.0
But I've got a better idea.,0.0
It's something I've worked on for 15 years.,0.0
It's called the automated check or the instant check.,0.0
It's being used in 17 states right now.,0.0
"States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states.",0.0
You don't buy any gun.,0.0
You don't get any gun.,0.0
We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.,0.0
"And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.",0.0
"I've been working on this for a long, long time.",0.0
"You walk in, you put your little card in there.",0.0
"If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.",0.0
"You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.",0.0
"If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.",0.0
The administration says they support the instant check.,0.0
"They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.",0.0
"In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.",0.0
This keeps up with technology.,0.0
It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.,0.0
That is the bottom line.,0.0
"And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.",0.0
And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.,0.0
You talk about the Brady Bill.,0.0
There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.,0.0
"And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.",0.0
Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.,0.0
"Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban.",0.0
"And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.",0.0
But let's look at the facts here.,0.0
"The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.",0.0
Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.,0.0
He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.,0.0
He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.,0.0
"Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.",1.0
But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.,0.0
"I mean, their rifles.",0.0
We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids.,0.0
And this is a safer country.,0.0
"So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.",0.0
"Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.",0.0
"I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.",0.0
But that's history.,0.0
I told the NRA that's history.,0.0
You're not going to worry about it anymore.,0.0
I'm not going to worry about it anymore.,0.0
Let's do something better.,0.0
Talking about this and this.,0.0
"So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.",0.0
"If he, that's what he said, he's not right about that.",0.0
Look at where we are today.,0.0
The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.,0.0
"I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.",0.0
"We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.",0.0
The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.,0.0
The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.,0.0
There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.,0.0
We have worked hard for peace and freedom.,0.0
"When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States.",0.0
"When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.",0.0
Peace in Bosnia.,0.0
"We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East.",0.0
We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.,0.0
"The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.",0.0
"Well, I have a different view.",0.0
"Again, Iâ€™ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year.",0.0
Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.,0.0
"But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.",1.0
"They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.",0.0
They asked for the tanks.,0.0
They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.,0.0
It's called mission creep.,0.0
We turn it over to the United Nations.,0.0
The President didn't have much to do about it.,0.0
"You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.",0.0
"You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.",0.0
So we need more protection from America.,0.0
"Bosnia, Northern Ireland.",0.0
There's no ceasefire in Bosnia.,0.0
I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.,0.0
"We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.",0.0
We haven't done that.,0.0
"We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home.",0.0
"Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.",0.0
"First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.",0.0
"I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.",0.0
"Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.",0.0
"Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.",1.0
"In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.",0.0
"But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.",0.0
"Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.",0.0
Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.,0.0
Now I think we have a selective engagement policy.,0.0
"We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.",0.0
"And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.",0.0
He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.,0.0
It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.,0.0
Look these are facts.,0.0
"And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.",0.0
He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.,0.0
That would be my position.,0.0
"Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.",0.0
We all fight over how much money is there.,0.0
"I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money.",0.0
"You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.",0.0
Devastated states like California and others.,0.0
And I think now we've got a problem.,0.0
We've got to go back and look.,0.0
"It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.",0.0
"You may have said that, too.",0.0
"But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.",0.0
"We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.",1.0
Our military is the strongest military in the world.,1.0
"It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.",1.0
There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.,0.0
We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.,0.0
"I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.",0.0
That is my solemn obligation.,0.0
You ask when do you decide to deploy them.,0.0
The interests of the American people must be at stake.,0.0
Our values must be at stake.,0.0
We have to be able to make a difference.,0.0
And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.,0.0
"But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait.",0.0
"I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.",1.0
"Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.",0.0
You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.,0.0
"They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.",0.0
"We lost 53,000 Americans.",0.0
We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.,0.0
It's a closed society.,0.0
We don't have any inspection.,0.0
"We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives.",0.0
Someone called them something else.,0.0
Incentives.,0.0
We don't know what's going to happen.,0.0
"Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.",0.0
"And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.",0.0
"Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy.",0.0
"In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.",1.0
"We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.",0.0
Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.,0.0
"They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation.",0.0
Senator Dole is correct.,0.0
"I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.",0.0
And the United States needs help from other countries.,0.0
Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.,0.0
But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.,0.0
"Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba.",0.0
"And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.",0.0
That's the point I made.,0.0
We have to be firm and strong.,0.0
And I hope that will happen.,0.0
It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.,0.0
We have not been firm and strong.,0.0
You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.,0.0
It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.,0.0
"In my view, the policy has failed.",0.0
"A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.",0.0
This is a serious business.,0.0
"It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.",0.0
"Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.",0.0
His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.,1.0
"And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.",1.0
So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.,0.0
Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.,0.0
"We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.",0.0
"I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.",0.0
The President was opposed to it in 1993.,0.0
"He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.",0.0
Most people want to see their own doctor.,1.0
They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.,1.0
We won't threaten anybody.,1.0
"So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.",0.0
"We've been for that for four, five, six years.",0.0
The President held it up.,0.0
"And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.",0.0
But it will cover preexisting conditions.,0.0
"If you change your job, you're going to be covered.",0.0
"So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.",1.0
But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.,0.0
"Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.",0.0
It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.,0.0
"Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.",0.0
"Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.",1.0
And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.,1.0
"Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.",0.0
The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.,0.0
I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.,1.0
"Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.",0.0
"You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start.",0.0
"I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.",0.0
"There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.",0.0
Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.,0.0
"In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.",0.0
Food.,0.0
"Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.",1.0
I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.,0.0
"And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.",0.0
Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.,0.0
It involves Turkey.,0.0
It's a real problem.,0.0
"We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.",0.0
Did we inflict any damage?,0.0
No.,0.0
"Well, we have Great Britain.",0.0
"They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.",0.0
"Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.",0.0
We had to get their permission.,0.0
"The bottom line is, we went in there alone.",0.0
We are supposed to be operating under a U. N. resolution.,0.0
We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.,0.0
Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.,0.0
"I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.",0.0
It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.,0.0
That's what I did.,0.0
I still believe it was the right thing to do.,0.0
"Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category?",0.0
I don't know.,0.0
I want to be very serious.,0.0
I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.,0.0
I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.,0.0
So it's not that we always disagree.,0.0
Others disagreed with us.,0.0
The Mideast is very difficult.,0.0
"But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.",0.0
Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.,0.0
Maybe that was the purpose.,0.0
But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.,0.0
"It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.",0.0
"Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.",0.0
"I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.",0.0
We've lost credibility around the world.,0.0
"Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.",0.0
"Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.",0.0
But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.,0.0
It is a very difficult environment.,0.0
The feelings are very strong.,0.0
There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.,0.0
Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.,1.0
"I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.",1.0
"And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.",0.0
"I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.",0.0
Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.,0.0
"Well, I was disappointed.",0.0
It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.,0.0
It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.,0.0
And I don't intend to politicize it.,0.0
I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.,0.0
"Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past.",0.0
And I think I know what he meant by that.,0.0
"He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.",0.0
"But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.",1.0
That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.,0.0
"And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates.",0.0
That's why we're moving in the right direction.,0.0
And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.,0.0
That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.,0.0
"That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it's got to be paid for.",0.0
"That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.",0.0
These are my commitments.,0.0
I am very oriented toward the future.,0.0
I think this election has to be geared toward the future.,0.0
"I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge.",0.0
But Kenny was a great talker.,0.0
And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.,0.0
"So we always had a rule, we divided by six.",0.0
Maybe in your case maybe just two.,0.0
"But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.",0.0
I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.,0.0
"I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.",0.0
But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.,0.0
Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.,0.0
I'm excited about it.,0.0
"It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.",1.0
"Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.",0.0
We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.,0.0
"There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.",0.0
The ones that are out there are doing well.,0.0
What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.,0.0
"If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.",0.0
But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.,0.0
"He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools.",0.0
"He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.",0.0
That's the issue.,0.0
90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.,0.0
I'd better correct the President.,0.0
"I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.",0.0
"I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.",0.0
I've supported all the education programs.,0.0
"I've supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it.",0.0
"So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.",0.0
Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.,0.0
"Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.",0.0
I support school choice.,0.0
"I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.",0.0
"But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.",0.0
"I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards.",0.0
"Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.",0.0
I have been a strong force for reform.,0.0
"And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.",0.0
I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.,0.0
I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.,0.0
"And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.",0.0
It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships.,0.0
"Now, it would have.",0.0
That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.,0.0
"We need to be doing more in education, not less.",0.0
"Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.",0.0
"It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.",0.0
"We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down.",0.0
"And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.",0.0
I like young people.,0.0
I like teachers.,0.0
I'm a product of a public school.,0.0
You attended a private school for some time in your life.,0.0
"You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again.",0.0
"When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.",0.0
"And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.",0.0
You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.,0.0
"Now that's not reform, Mr. President.",0.0
Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.,0.0
Some schools aren't safe.,1.0
Some schools aren't even safe.,1.0
Your choice is nothing.,1.0
"Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.",0.0
"If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.",0.0
"First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight.",0.0
"I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.",0.0
"And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there.",0.0
"You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.",0.0
"Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.",0.0
"If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.",0.0
I might say the results are highly ambiguous.,0.0
"It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.",0.0
"I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration.",0.0
And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.,0.0
"Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things.",0.0
I feel strongly about education.,0.0
"I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights.",0.0
We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.,0.0
"Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.",0.0
"It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money.",0.0
"It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.",0.0
But this is a very liberal administration.,0.0
This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system.,0.0
This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business.,0.0
"This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind.",0.0
I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.,0.0
There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.,0.0
There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.,0.0
"When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about.",0.0
"And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.",1.0
"It's sort of their golden oldie, you know.",1.0
It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.,0.0
And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.,0.0
The American people should make up their own mind.,1.0
"Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.",0.0
We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.,0.0
"We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.",0.0
The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.,1.0
"Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.",1.0
"Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.",0.0
"You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President.",0.0
Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.,0.0
"The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.",0.0
And even some in your own party couldn't buy that.,0.0
I remember talking by the telephone.,0.0
I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.,0.0
"In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.",0.0
"I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.",0.0
I don't believe in discrimination.,0.0
I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy.,0.0
"I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.",0.0
"It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.",0.0
"And I did stop them, I admit that.",0.0
I sure stopped their budget.,0.0
Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.,0.0
"It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.",0.0
It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.,0.0
Their budget weakened our support for education.,0.0
"$30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans.",0.0
"Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.",0.0
It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.,0.0
It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.,0.0
"Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.",0.0
"Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.",1.0
"George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal.",1.0
"I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.",0.0
And so I think you take a look at it.,0.0
"The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.",0.0
They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.,0.0
Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?,0.0
"Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money?",0.0
That's why we want an economic package.,0.0
We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.,0.0
That's what our message is to the people watching.,0.0
"Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.",0.0
"The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.",0.0
"And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.",0.0
"Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut.",0.0
"I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.",0.0
"So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.",0.0
The people want economic reform.,0.0
They're having a hard time making ends meet.,0.0
"You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.",0.0
This is important business.,0.0
This is about getting the economy moving again.,0.0
This is about American jobs and opportunities.,0.0
"It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.",0.0
When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money.,0.0
I think the government can do better.,0.0
Are there personal differences?,0.0
"Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign.",0.0
So I think he's a bit taller than I am.,0.0
But I think there are personal differences.,0.0
"I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.",0.0
"As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.",0.0
It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.,0.0
And not about personal things.,0.0
"You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.",0.0
I know he wants to disown it.,0.0
"I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.",1.0
"Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances.",0.0
"But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.",0.0
Investing in our environment.,0.0
Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.,0.0
Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.,0.0
"Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.",1.0
"Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.",1.0
It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.,1.0
"Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.",0.0
"Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.",0.0
"You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.",0.0
"Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.",0.0
"And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally.",0.0
I'm not discussing Whitewater now.,0.0
And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.,0.0
"Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.",0.0
He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.,0.0
Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.,0.0
This is an issue they've brought up.,0.0
"It's under, there's been no consideration of it, no discussion of it.",0.0
I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.,0.0
"And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.",0.0
This is something I take seriously and that's my position.,0.0
Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.,0.0
"I mean, you may be sending a signal.",0.0
"I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.",0.0
"But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.",0.0
And I think he made a mistake.,0.0
"And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.",0.0
But apparently his position hasn't changed.,0.0
"If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.",0.0
We've had that discussion.,0.0
"And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.",0.0
And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.,0.0
"I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.",1.0
"You know, so one of your liberal friends.",1.0
No comment.,0.0
What's the subject matter?,0.0
"See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.",0.0
"I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.",0.0
I happen to like President Clinton personally.,0.0
I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.,0.0
I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.,0.0
But I respect the presidency.,0.0
I've served under a number of presidents.,0.0
They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.,0.0
So I'd rather talk about my strengths.,0.0
And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.,0.0
"It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.",0.0
You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens.,1.0
"I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.",0.0
"I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.",0.0
I have relatives on Medicare.,0.0
I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents.,1.0
"I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.",1.0
And I'll keep my word on the economic package.,0.0
"If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.",0.0
"People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.",0.0
That's what this race is all about.,0.0
I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.,0.0
And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.,0.0
But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan.,0.0
"A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform.",0.0
A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work.,0.0
"Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work.",0.0
A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while.,0.0
A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.,0.0
That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.,0.0
And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.,0.0
"The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.",0.0
"And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.",0.0
We just see the world in different ways.,0.0
And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.,1.0
"Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.",0.0
I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program.,0.0
We now have 2500 hospices.,0.0
I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.,0.0
"President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.",0.0
He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.,0.0
But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.,0.0
I wasn't just getting more power and more power.,0.0
"So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.",1.0
"We can give you all these numbers, they don't mean a thing.",0.0
"If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?",0.0
"You know, America's best days are ahead of us.",0.0
"I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.",0.0
Let's look at that.,0.0
"When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.",0.0
"We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses.",0.0
"I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.",0.0
"I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.",0.0
I said we'd get tougher with child support and child support enforcement's up 50 percent.,0.0
I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.,0.0
The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.,0.0
"Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.",1.0
"We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.",0.0
But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.,0.0
He didn't do all these things.,0.0
Let's take all these four years in a row.,0.0
"He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.",0.0
"The S &amp; L crisis was over, they're starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in.",0.0
"And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.",0.0
He talks about a smaller government.,1.0
There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.,1.0
They're gone.,1.0
"The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not.",1.0
"In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.",0.0
"So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due.",0.0
"Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs.",0.0
"So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland.",0.0
"A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.",0.0
When I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.,0.0
I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.,0.0
But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.,0.0
"Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.",0.0
We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.,0.0
"It is not midnight in America, Senator.",0.0
All right.,0.0
"Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.",0.0
I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.,0.0
"I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.",0.0
I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago.,1.0
And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.,0.0
I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.,0.0
The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again.,0.0
All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children.,0.0
And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.,0.0
I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act.,1.0
I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.,0.0
"Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.",1.0
"Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening.",0.0
"I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century.",0.0
They're the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same.,0.0
"And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.",0.0
"It's important, it's their future.",0.0
And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.,0.0
"And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it.",0.0
And I know that I'm someone older than you.,0.0
But I've had my anxious moments in my life.,0.0
I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.,0.0
I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.,0.0
"I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.",0.0
We are the greatest country on the face of the earth.,1.0
"We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.",1.0
This election is important.,0.0
"I ask for your support, I ask for your help.",0.0
God bless America.,0.0
"Wow, in 90 seconds?",0.0
I can't clear my throat in 90 seconds.,0.0
"Jim, Bob Dole and myself do not see Al Gore and Bill Clinton as our enemy.",0.0
We see them as our opponents.,0.0
This is the greatest democracy in the world.,1.0
"People are watching not only throughout this country, but all over the world as to how this democracy can function with civility and respect, and decency and integrity.",0.0
"Bob Dole, um, is one of those men who served in the United States Senate, his public life is a public record.",0.0
He fought on the battlefield.,0.0
He has worked with Democrats and Republicans.,0.0
"In my opinion, it is beneath Bob Dole to go after anyone personally.",0.0
"Clearly, Abraham Lincoln put it best when he said you serve your party best by serving the nation first.",1.0
And I can't think of a better way of serving this nation in 1996 than by electing Bob Dole as the President of the United States of America.,0.0
These issues are fully capable of being understood and reflected upon by the American people.,0.0
This is a democracy in which we have the freest press and the greatest First Amendment rights in the history of mankind.,1.0
And Bob and I respect that.,0.0
"These issues will be aired, but they'll be aired with dignity and respect, and, ultimately, leave it to the American people to make up their minds about who should be the leader of this country into the 21st Century.",0.0
"Thank you, Mr. Lehrer.",0.0
And I would like to thank the people of St. Petersburg for being such wonderful hosts.,0.0
My family and I are very glad to be here and I would like to thank Jack Kemp for the answer that he just gave.,0.0
I think we have an opportunity tonight to have a positive debate about this country's future.,0.0
"I'd like to start by offering you a deal, Jack.",0.0
"If you won't use any football stories, I won't tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement.",0.0
It's a deal.,0.0
I can't even pronounce it.,0.0
What I do want to talk about tonight is Bill Clinton's positive plan for America's future.,0.0
"We have a plan to balance the budget while protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.",0.0
"Creating millions of new jobs, including one million new jobs in America's inner cities.",0.0
"I'm excited about the chance to talk about this plan and even more excited about the chance to work on it, if you, the people of this country, will give Bill Clinton and me the privilege of doing so for four more years.",0.0
"I really got only two differences with Bill Clinton -- Â President Clinton and Mr. Gore, foreign policy and domestic policy.",0.0
"Our foreign policy is ambivalent, confusing, it is sending strong signals to the wrong people, and we have learned over the years that weakness is provocative, but domestic economy is not doing what it can do.",0.0
This President believes we are at our capacity.,0.0
Bob Dole and I believe we can do a lot better.,0.0
It is about the potential of the American people to lift themselves up and not have their lives controlled by the United States Government and Washington.,0.0
The differences are very clear.,0.0
We have a positive plan based on three principles.,0.0
We want to provide opportunity for all Americans.,0.0
"We insist on responsibility being accepted in turn by everyone, and we want to strengthen our communities and their ability to support families and individuals in our common effort to create a bright future.",0.0
Here's how we plan to do that: We have a balanced budget plan that has targeted tax cuts for middle-income families.,0.0
We've already given tax cuts to 15 million of the hardest pressed working families in America.,0.0
"Our plan for the next four years features a $1,500 tax credit, called a Hope Scholarship, for tuition at community college, junior college or college.",0.0
"A $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition for those who go further, so that, in essence, no American family will ever be taxed on the money they spend for college tuition.",0.0
"Also, tax relief for first-time home buyers, tax encouragement for savings and help in paying health care expenses, and a tax break, actually, the elimination of capital gains taxes on the -- on the profits from the sale of a home.",0.0
"All of this is within a balanced budget plan, which protects Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.",0.0
"Jim, this economy is overtaxed, overregulated, too many people suing each other, there's too much litigation.",0.0
Our education is not up to the standards that the American family and the American people want for their children.,1.0
"And, clearly, the welfare system is a disgrace to our Judeo-Christian principles.",0.0
"It is not the values of the poor that should be called into question, it is the values of the welfare system from Washington and uh that prevent people from climbing out of poverty.",0.0
"Our biggest debate with this administration on domestic policy is that they think we're at our fullest capacity, that weâ€™ve reached our potential and 2.5 percent growth is enough for America.",0.0
"Frankly, that is not good enough for this country.",0.0
We can not just run the clock out on the 20th Century.,0.0
"It, clearly, we need to lower the tax rate across the board on working and saving and investing.",0.0
"I know my friend, Al, will suggest that is trickle-down economics.",0.0
"Well, Al, if it's trickle-down economics, ask Van Woods, a young entrepreneur who owns a restaurant in Harlem, if it's trickle down.",0.0
He said he would hire 60 more people if we cut the Capital Gains Tax.,0.0
I talked about our positive agenda for the future a moment ago.,0.0
"The plan from Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp is a risky, $550-billion tax scheme that actually raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest pressed working families.",0.0
"It would blow a hole in the deficit, cause much deeper cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment and knock our economy off track, raising interest rates, mortgage rates and car payments.",0.0
We stopped that plan before.,0.0
We will stop it again.,0.0
We want a positive plan for growth and more jobs.,0.0
"Well, this is a perfect example.",0.0
"Bob Dole and I want to cut the tax rates across the board on each and every American, working, saving, investing and taking risks in America.",0.0
"All wealth is created, and all growth is generated by risk-taking entrepreneurs.",0.0
The tax rate on capital in America is way too high.,0.0
It's too high on the family and it's particularly too high on working men and women.,0.0
"The average family in America, at median level of income, probably is spending 25 to 26 percent of their income sent to the federal government.",0.0
"That's more than shelter, food, clothing, and energy.",0.0
That's just not right.,0.0
"When I was growing up in Los Angeles, my parents were a one working family, one breadwinner per family was all that was necessary.",0.0
"Bill Clinton, the President, and Al Gore, suggest that they'll give us a tax cut, but only if we do exactly what they want us to do.",0.0
That isn't America.,0.0
That's social engineering.,0.0
This risky tax scheme would blow a hole in the deficit.,0.0
You don't have to take my word for it.,0.0
"""Time,"" ""Newsweek,"" ""U. S. News &amp; World Report,"" ""Business Week,"" 83 percent of hundreds of economists in a random survey just recently all said it would blow a hole in the deficit.",0.0
There's another feature I would like to hear Mr. Kemp speak about.,0.0
"Just before he joined Senator Dole on the ticket, he said that the plan -- the part of the plan that raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest working families in America was unconscionable, that means it's wrong and it shouldn't happen.",0.0
"I agree, it is still part of the plan.",0.0
We believe that taxes should not be increased on those families.,0.0
"We have a plan to cut taxes on middle income families within a balanced budget plan, eliminating the deficit and protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.",0.0
"Every time this country in the 20th Century has cut tax rates across the board, revenues went up, the economy grew, and I am surprised at this point in his career that Vice President Gore and the President cannot understand that you get more revenue from a bigger pie, and clearly, creating more jobs reduces the social welfare drain, clearly makes more opportunity for capital to be invested in our inner cities.",0.0
"And frankly, Al, we shouldn't just tinker with the Capital Gain Tax, we should eliminate it in the inner cities of America to put capital to work to make democratic capitalism and jobs available in our inner cities of the United States.",0.0
Yes.,0.0
"President Clinton addressed this issue when he said, ""Mend it, don't end it.""",0.0
Diversity is a great strength in America.,0.0
"Look around the world at other places where they have not paid attention to the necessity of promoting harmony of, between different ethnic, racial and religious, and cultural groups.",0.0
"We ought to be very proud in our country, as most Americans are, that we've made tremendous progress, but we ought to recognize that we have more work to do.",1.0
"Now, the first thing that we are trying to do is to create a million new jobs in the inner cities of this country, with tax credits for employers who hire people who are now unemployed.",0.0
We are seeking to have vigorous enforcement of the laws that bar discrimination.,0.0
"Now, I want to congratulate Mr. Kemp for being a lonely voice in the Republican party over the years on this question.",1.0
"It is -- it is with some sadness that I refer to the fact that the day after he joined Senator Dole's ticket, he announced that he was changing his position and was hereto, thereafter going to adopt Senator Dole's position to end all affirmative action.",1.0
That's not good for our country.,0.0
"Bill Clinton and I believe that the United States of America has its brightest days ahead, and we will see them even brighter if we promote diversity and harmony among all our people.",0.0
"Jim, my position on Affirmative Action has been clear ever since I left the professional football career for Congress in 1970.",0.0
"Some people think I quit playing a few years earlier, but I retired in 1970.",0.0
"My life has been dedicated to equality of opportunity and our democracy should provide that, not equality of reward.",0.0
"Uh, Affirmative Action should be predicated upon need, not equality of reward, not equality of outcome.",0.0
Quotas have always been against the American ideal.,0.0
People need to own.,0.0
And that's what Abraham Lincoln believed.,0.0
"That when people own something, they have a stake in the American dream.",1.0
That is Affirmative Action in America.,1.0
"With all due respect, I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted Bob Dole's position to end all affirmative action.",1.0
There is a specific measure on the ballot in California.,0.0
"It was embodied in legislation, introduced by Senator Dole, to apply to the whole nation.",0.0
"Mr. Kemp campaigned against it, spoke against it, wrote letters against it, went to California to fight against it, and now has endorsed it.",0.0
I don't think it's a minor matter.,0.0
"I think this is one of the most important challenges that our country has to face in the future, and I hope that Mr. Kemp will try to persuade Senator Dole to adopt Mr. Kemp's position, instead of the other way around.",0.0
"You thought that was going to be your problem, not mine.",0.0
I can't believe I'm keeping within the time limit.,0.0
"Yeah, we really do.",0.0
"Um, this country has yet to deal with the type of inclusionary policies.",0.0
"It is so very important for Americans, white and black, Jew and Christian, immigrant and native-born, to sit down and talk and listen and begin to understand what it's like to come from that different perspective.",0.0
"Our country is as the Kerner Commission Report suggested a number of years ago was being split, but they said between white and black.",0.0
"I think it's being split, Jim, not so much between white and black, although that's still a very serious problem.",0.0
We really have two economies.,0.0
"Our general economy, our national economy, our mainstream economy is democratic, is based on incentives, a small ""d"" Al, it's capitalism and incentives for working and saving and investing and producing, and families and the things that really lead to progress up that ladder that we call ""The American Dream,"" but is what is really universal.",1.0
"But unfortunately, in urban America, and I was glad to hear the Vice President talk a little bit about it, uh there -- they have abandoned the inner cities.",0.0
There's a socialist economy.,0.0
There's no private housing.,0.0
There's mostly public housing.,0.0
"You're told where to go to school, you're told what to buy with food stamps.",0.0
It is a welfare system that is more like a third-world socialist country than what we would expect from the world's greatest democratic free-enterprise system.,1.0
"That must change, and it will under Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.",0.0
Remember what I said just a moment ago.,0.0
"If it were not so, he would have told you.",0.0
The problems between races in America must be addressed.,1.0
The good news is we're making progress.,0.0
We've seen 10.5 million new jobs created in the last four years.,0.0
We've seen the unemployment rate come down dramatically.,0.0
We've seen the African-American unemployment rate go below double digits for the first time in 25 years and it stayed below for 25 months in a row.,0.0
"We have empowerment zones and enterprise communities, 105 of them in communities all across the United States of America.",0.0
Let me tell you a story about Joann Crowder in Detroit.,0.0
She was on welfare for eight years until the empowerment zone was created there.,0.0
She just got a job in the new business that -- that launched its enterprise right in that empowerment zone.,0.0
We want to do that for millions more all across the country.,0.0
"Well, with all due respect, Jim, there are nine empowerment zones, a few little tinkering with tax credits around the country for inner cities.",0.0
"Los Angeles, after the riots, did not even get an empowerment zone, believe it or not.",0.0
"That is just unconscionable in America to have left Watts, South Central and East L. A. out.",0.0
"Earl Graves of ""Black Enterprise"" magazine said the single greatest deterrent to black advancement is the lack of access to capital, the credit and ownership.",0.0
That will change.,0.0
"We will green-line every city in the United States where there is unemployment and welfare and we will eliminate the Capital Gains Tax, eliminate the tax on a welfare mother that takes a job.",0.0
That is the answer.,0.0
"Give ownership and entrepreneurship to low income people based on need, not the color of their skin.",0.0
"Before I answer that specific question, let me say that we did put an empowerment zone in South Central, Los Angeles.",0.0
"It is in the form of the largest community development financial institution ever created in the United States or in any other country and it is creating jobs in South Central, Los Angeles right now.",0.0
The Congress passed uh an enterprise zone after the Los Angeles riots five years ago.,0.0
It was vetoed by the prior administration.,0.0
"Now, to your question.",0.0
"We have a specific plan to create 1 million new jobs in the inner cities of America with tax credits for employers who hire people coming off welfare, 'cause we've passed welfare reform now, we promised to end welfare as we know it.",0.0
We have moved 1.9 million people off of the welfare rolls and into good jobs in the last four years.,0.0
"Our new plan is to have 1 million more jobs in the inner cities, but that's not all.",0.0

Drop dead.,0.0
"We don't want to change the legislation that would lower the tax rate in D. C., allow welfare mothers to take a job without any tax on the first 90 percent of her income and no Capital Gain Tax that should be done in every urban area of America that would make capital flow back, and you can't have capitalism, Al, without capital.",0.0
"You may want to give a tax credit, but it won't work.",0.0
"Well, we have 105 empowerment zones and enterprise communities all across the United States of America, and with all due respect, that's 105 more than were there when we came into the White House.",0.0
We have been implementing them in a determined way.,0.0
They are making a difference.,0.0
"You know, that empowerment zone that I mentioned in Detroit is creating jobs not only for Joann Crowder, who feels proud that she's off of welfare now, and we're proud of her.",0.0
"It's creating jobs for hundreds of others, and similar initiatives are working in the other empowerment zones.",0.0
"The single greatest problem in our opinion, domestic -- in the domestic economy, is that this tax code, 83 years old, a relic of the Cold War and Hot War, inflation and depression, seven-and-a-half million words long, overtaxes capital, overtaxes working men and women and families.",0.0
"Clearly, the Gordian knot needs to be broken in one fell swoop.",0.0
"Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, as soon as we get through this first step of cutting tax rates across the board, are going to repeal the whole code while Bill Clinton and my friend, Al Gore, defend the status quo.",0.0
"We're going to repeal the seven-and-a-half million words of the U. S.tax code, make it tax income once, not twice, three, four, and if you die, it confiscates your estate.",0.0
We must have a tax code going into the 21st Century that does not protect the establishment and this tax code does.,0.0
"And by cutting and eliminating the Capital Gains, by cutting and eliminating the Estate Tax, by bringing the top tax rate down to something reasonable, like -- here he goes again -- I think in peacetime, it shouldn't be higher, Bob, and I don't think it should be higher than 25 percent, phased in.",0.0

The problem with this version of Niagara Falls is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the economy in a barrel and send it over the falls.,0.0

I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience.,0.0
I have questioned his proposals.,0.0
I think this is a very important moment for our country.,0.0
We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.,1.0
"And in this election, America has to make an important choice.",0.0
"Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families?",0.0
I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices.,0.0
"If I'm entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make.",0.0
I will balance the budget every year.,0.0
I will pay down the national debt.,0.0
I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.,0.0
And I will cut taxes for middle-class families.,0.0
I believe it's important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus.,0.0
"If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people.",0.0
"If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won't be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe.",0.0
By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution.,0.0
I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families.,0.0
"And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security.",0.0
That is my agenda and that is why I think that it's not just a question of experience.,0.0
"Well, we do come from different places.",0.0
I come from West Texas.,0.0
I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.,0.0
"One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills.",0.0
I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut.,0.0
"And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.",0.0
His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.,0.0
"It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats.",0.0
Tonight youâ€™re going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.,0.0
"Yes, Jim.",0.0
"I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.",0.0
And let me give you an example of what I mean.,0.0
"Under Governor Bush's tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined.",0.0
"Now, I think those are the wrong priorities.",0.0
"Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts.",0.0
"And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.",0.0
I think it's very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it.,0.0
And I also think it's very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform.,0.0
Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.,0.0
I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we've moved millions of people in America into good jobs.,0.0
"But it's now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.",0.0
Let me just say that obviously tonight we're going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do.,1.0
People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion.,0.0
And my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?,0.0
Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills.,0.0
There is a difference of opinion.,0.0
My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the government's money.,0.0
That's not what I think.,0.0
I think it's the hard-working people of America's money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families.,1.0
It's a difference of opinion.,0.0
It's a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself.,0.0
Yes.,0.0
I take him for his word.,0.0
"Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington.",0.0
I'm from Texas.,0.0
"And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I.",0.0
And I've been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union.,0.0
"I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.",0.0
"Somebody that can come to Washington and say let's forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word.",0.0
"Jim, if I could just respond.",0.0
I know that.,0.0
"The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct.",0.0
"He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.",0.0
"I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money.",0.0
"That's why I don't think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.",0.0
I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.,0.0
And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors.,0.0
And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.,0.0
It seems like they can't get it done.,0.0
"Now, they may blame other folks, but it's time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors.",0.0
And so what I've said is that there's been some missed opportunities.,0.0
They've had a chance.,0.0
They've had a chance to form consensus.,0.0
"I've got a plan on Medicare, for example, that's a two-stage plan that says we'll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program.",0.0
"But I also want to say to seniors, if you're happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program.",0.0
But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.,0.0
That's what I've been critical about the administration for.,0.0
Same with Social Security.,0.0
I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without.,0.0
"Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there's a Social Security system around tomorrow.",0.0
"There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.",0.0
"Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare.",0.0
The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.,0.0
"It's not, and let me explain the difference.",0.0
"Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I'm making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor.",0.0
Your doctor chooses your prescription.,0.0
No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you.,0.0
Then you go to your own pharmacy.,0.0
You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost.,0.0
"If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.",0.0
Now here is the contrast.,0.0
95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent's plan for the first four or five years.,0.0
"Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?",0.0
I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare.,1.0
Trying to frighten people in the voting booth.,0.0
I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.,0.0
We need to reform Medicare.,0.0
Thereâ€™s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it.,0.0
"And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.",0.0
"The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.",0.0
If you're happy with the system you can stay in it.,0.0
But there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times.,0.0
I believe we ought to give seniors more options.,0.0
I believe we ought to make the system work better.,0.0
"I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let's come together.",0.0
"You've had your chance, Vice President, you've been there for eight years and nothing has been done.",0.0
"My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years.",0.0
If I could respond to that.,0.0
The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it.,0.0
I donâ€™t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Â $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.,0.0
Now here is the difference.,0.0
Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts.,0.0
"Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.",0.0
Let me give you one quick example.,0.0
There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee.,0.0
"He's 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble.",0.0
"They have an income of $25,000 a year.",0.0
They can't pay for their prescription drugs and so they're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs.,0.0
"Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.",0.0
"Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.",0.0
"I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of we're going to scare you in the voting booth.",0.0
Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.,0.0
It's called Immediate Helping Hand.,0.0
"Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help.",1.0
Let me say something.,0.0
"They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.",0.0
"Look, this is a man who has great numbers.",0.0
He talks about numbers.,0.0
"I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.",0.0
It's fuzzy math.,0.0
It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.,1.0
"Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third.",0.0
The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.,0.0
But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%.,0.0
Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.,0.0
"If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay.",0.0
It's from $4000 to about $2000.,0.0
"Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.",0.0
It's just clear you can go to the website and look.,0.0
And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.,0.0
Correct.,0.0
That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.,0.0
Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.,0.0
They have had their chance to get something done.,0.0
"All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.",0.0
Let me call your attention to the key word there.,0.0
He said all poor seniors.,0.0
Wait a minute.,0.0
All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.,0.0
In the first year?,0.0
"If we can get it done in the first year, you bet.",0.0
Yours is phased in in eight years.,0.0
It's a two-phase plan.,0.0
For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered.,0.0
Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.,0.0
I don't think a president can do that.,0.0
"I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.",0.0
"This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue.",0.0
I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.,1.0
Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.,0.0
Life of the unborn.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.",0.0
I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.,0.0
I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.,0.0
This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement.,0.0
I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.,0.0
We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time.,0.0
Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.,0.0
Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors.,1.0
Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.,1.0
Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.,0.0
"As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.",0.0
I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.,0.0
"Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision.",0.0
They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug.,0.0
This is indeed a very important issue.,0.0
"First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.",0.0
That's not the main issue.,0.0
The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.,0.0
I support a woman's right to choose.,0.0
My opponent does not.,0.0
It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.,0.0
"And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.",0.0
Here is the difference.,0.0
He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.,0.0
"I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.",0.0
And I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended.,0.0
I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.,0.0
The FDA has made its decision.,0.0
"Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.",0.0
"And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision.",0.0
Now that sounds to me a little bit different.,0.0
I just think that we ought to support the decision.,0.0
I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.,0.0
I am pro-life.,0.0
The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue.,0.0
Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.,0.0
That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.,0.0
I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.,0.0
That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.,0.0
They shouldn't misuse their bench.,0.0
I don't believe in liberal activist judges.,0.0
I believe in strict constructionists.,0.0
Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.,0.0
We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome.,0.0
"I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.",0.0
"And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.",0.0
"And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.",0.0
"And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade.",0.0
It's very clear to me.,0.0
I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.,0.0
I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.,0.0
I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.,0.0
That's what a governor gets to do.,0.0
A governor gets to name supreme court judges.,0.0
He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan.,0.0
I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.,0.0
I do believe it's wrong to use a litmus test.,0.0
"If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.",0.0
"A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue.",0.0
Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost.,0.0
"It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.",0.0
I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.,0.0
"He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.",0.0
No.,0.0
That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.,0.0
"Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear.",0.0
Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be.,0.0
"Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win.",0.0
Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.,0.0
"And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.",0.0
I would take the use of force very seriously.,0.0
I would be guarded in my approach.,0.0
I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world.,0.0
I think we've got to be very careful when we commit our troops.,0.0
The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.,0.0
He believes in nation building.,0.0
I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders.,0.0
I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.,0.0
And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.,0.0
We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.,0.0
"We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals.",0.0
Some of our troops are not well-equipped.,0.0
I believe we're overextended in too many places.,0.0
And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.,0.0
It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.,0.0
A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law.,0.0
It's to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped.,0.0
Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.,0.0
The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.,0.0
Let me tell you what Iâ€™ll do.,0.0
"First of all Â I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world.",1.0
"Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.",0.0
"If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.",0.0
"In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.",0.0
"But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.",0.0
"Now, just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up.",0.0
I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk.,0.0
"I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there's a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.",0.0
"I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, that's not the question.",0.0
The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come?,0.0
The warning signs are real.,0.0
Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be.,0.0
"A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up.",0.0
The captains are leaving the service.,0.0
There is a problem.,0.0
And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.,0.0
The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.,1.0
"They said even if we are the strongest if we donâ€™t do something if we don't have a clear vision of the military, if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I'm going to prevent that.",0.0
I'm going to rebuild our military power.,0.0
It's one of the major priorities of my administration.,0.0
"Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds.",0.0
"When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army.",0.0
I served my country in Vietnam.,0.0
My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.,0.0
"I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did.",0.0
"But I went anyway because I knew if I didn't, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place.",0.0
"I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control.",0.0
I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee.,0.0
"For the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II.",0.0
"Look, that's where World War I started in the Balkans.",0.0
My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there.,1.0
Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict.,0.0
"We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments.",0.0
"Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.",0.0
The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons.,0.0
"I think that's a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge.",0.0
I think you've got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office.,0.0
Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.,0.0
We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.,0.0
We need decisions made on sound principles.,0.0
I've been the governor of a big state.,0.0
"I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that I've had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats.",0.0
I think that's an important part of leadership.,0.0
I think what it means to build consensus.,0.0
I've shown I know how to do so.,0.0
"Tonight in the audience there's one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state-wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to -- because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead.",1.0
"And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?",0.0
One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re-establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water's edge.,0.0
"When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way.",0.0
"When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father.",0.0
I think bipartisanship is a national asset.,0.0
We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.,0.0
Why haven't they done it in seven years?,0.0
"Oh, absolutely.",0.0
This is a very important moment in the history of our country.,0.0
"Look, we've got the biggest surpluses in all of American history.",0.0
The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.,0.0
"Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush's plan, go to the wealthiest 1%.",0.0
I think we have to make the right and responsible choices.,0.0
"I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies.",0.0
I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to.,0.0
I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.,0.0
The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox.,0.0
I don't think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs.,0.0
I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.,0.0
I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.,0.0
"Now, the priorities are just very different.",0.0
I'll give you a couple of examples.,0.0
"For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.",0.0
"Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.",0.0
Those are very clear differences.,0.0
The man is practicing fuzzy math again.,0.0
There's differences.,0.0
"Under Vice President Gore's plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965.",0.0
"We're talking about a massive government, folks.",0.0
"We're talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats.",0.0
Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.,0.0
There is a huge difference in this campaign.,0.0
He says he's going to give you tax cuts.,0.0
50 million of you won't receive it.,0.0
He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief.,0.0
That's not the role of a president to decide right and wrong.,0.0
Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.,0.0
"After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, won't pay any tax at all.",0.0
It's a huge difference.,0.0
A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own.,0.0
"Let me just say, Jim, you haven't heard the governor deny these numbers.",0.0
He's called them phony and fuzzy.,1.0
The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.,0.0
More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here?,0.0
Let me tell you what the facts are.,0.0
"The facts are after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today.",0.0
"Secondly, if you're a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut.",0.0
Let me give you one example.,0.0
"The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day.",0.0
"They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.",0.0
"Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief.",0.0
"Under Vice President Gore's plan, they get $145 of tax relief.",0.0
Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence.,0.0
You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense.,0.0
"No, I don't, and I'm not going to go to calling names on his facts.",0.0
I'm just gonna tell you what the real facts are.,0.0
The analysis that he's talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed.,0.0
"And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined.",0.0
Now those are the wrong priorities.,0.0
$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.,0.0
"As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.",0.0
Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal.,0.0
Let me give you some specific examples.,0.0
"I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college.",0.0
I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill.,0.0
We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.,0.0
Let me talk about tax cuts one more time.,0.0
This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans.,0.0
Not so.,0.0
Take for example the marriage penalty.,1.0
"If you itemize your tax return, you get no marriage penalty relief.",1.0
He picks and chooses.,0.0
He decides who the right people are.,0.0
It's a fundamental difference of opinion.,0.0
I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time.,0.0
"I want to say something, Jim.",0.0
This man has been disparaging my plan with all this Washington fuzzy math.,1.0
"If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right.",0.0
Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief.,0.0
We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results.,0.0
"Let me give you a story about public education, if I might.",0.0
"It's about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas.",0.0
I want to teach.,0.0
A guy named Michael runs the school.,0.0
It is a school full of so-called at-risk children.,0.0
It's how we unfortunately label certain children.,0.0
It's a school of strong discipline and high standards.,0.0
It's one of the best schools in Houston.,0.0
Here are the key ingredients.,0.0
"High expectations, strong accountabily.",0.0
"What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade.",0.0
That's what we do.,0.0
"And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas.",0.0
That's my vision for public education all around America.,0.0
"Many of you viewers don't know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school.",0.0
They went to Austin High School.,0.0
And many of the public schools are meeting the call.,0.0
"But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.",0.0
Here is the role of the federal government.,0.0
One is to change Head Start to a reading program.,0.0
The goal is for every single child to learn to Read.,0.0
What I care about is children.,0.0
And so does Michael Feinberg.,0.0
And you know what?,0.0
It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership.,0.0
We agree on a couple of things on education.,0.0
"I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush.",0.0
"I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush.",0.0
I'm in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance.,0.0
"Every school and every school district, have every state test the children.",0.0
"I've also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed.",0.0
"We've got to recruit 100,000 new teachers.",0.0
And I have budgeted for that.,0.0
We've got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher.,0.0
"We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year.",0.0
I would like to tell you a quick story.,0.0
"I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida.",0.0
I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.,0.0
We had a great time.,0.0
Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant.,0.0
His name is Randy Ellis.,0.0
"He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School.",1.0
Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.,1.0
She's the 36th student in that classroom.,1.0
They sent me a picture of her in the classroom.,1.0
"They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.",1.0
"I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.",0.0
"The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.",0.0
He says he's for voluntary testing.,0.0
You can't have voluntary testing.,0.0
You must have mandatory testing.,0.0
You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract.,0.0
That's the difference.,0.0
"You may claim you've got mandatory testing but you don't, Mr. Vice President.",0.0
That's a huge difference.,0.0
Testing is the cornerstone of reform.,0.0
You know how I know?,0.0
Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.,0.0
Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?,0.0
We've done a long way working together to do so.,0.0
We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools.,0.0
We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.,0.0
"I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won't teach, we need to free the parents.",0.0
We need to expand education savings accounts.,0.0
There's big differences.,0.0
He won't support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money.,0.0
"First of all, I do have mandatory testing.",0.0
I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.,0.0
"All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.",0.0
"Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim.",0.0
Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don't have to take all applicants.,0.0
"Now, private schools play a great role in our society.",0.0
All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools.,0.0
But I don't think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom.,0.0
Let me give you another example.,0.0
"I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning.",0.0
"Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country.",0.0
There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.,0.0
We're in an information age when learning is more important than ever.,0.0
We have to make it the number one priority.,0.0
"Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality -- high-quality, safe school.",0.0
"If it's a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina.",0.0
Here is another difference.,0.0
"The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school.",0.0
It's an illusion.,1.0
Okay.,0.0
"First of all, most of good governance is at the state level.",0.0
"See, here is the mentality.",0.0
I'm going to make the state do this and make the state do that.,0.0
"All I'm saying is if you spend money, show us results and test every year, which you do not do, Mr. Vice President.",0.0
You don't test every year.,0.0
"You can say you do to the cameras but you don't, unless you've changed your plan here on the stage.",0.0
You need to test every year.,0.0
"Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.",0.0
"More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind.",0.0
"Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you?",0.0
"Start asking the question, what do you know?",0.0
"If you don't know what you're supposed to know, we'll make sure you do early before it's too late.",0.0
"When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat.",0.0
"I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia.",0.0
"Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years.",0.0
"I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim.",0.0
"And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies.",0.0
"They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power.",0.0
I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.,1.0
You can see it in this campaign.,0.0
The big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal.,1.0
They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.,1.0
"I've been standing up to big Hollywood, big trial lawyers.",0.0
"It was about emergencies, wasn't it?",0.0
"You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.",0.0
"I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas.",0.0
I remember the floods that swept our state.,0.0
"I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas.",0.0
I have to pay the administration a compliment.,0.0
James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis.,0.0
"But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.",0.0
It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted.,1.0
"The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them.",0.0
That's what governors do.,0.0
"Well, it depends, obviously.",0.0
"But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances.",0.0
"I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.",0.0
I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.,0.0
And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.,0.0
That's what governors end up doing.,0.0
We end up being problem solvers.,0.0
"We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that we're confronted with.",0.0
"In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.",0.0
First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas.,0.0
I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.,0.0
And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts.,0.0
"And I agree, it works extremely well now.",0.0
I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.,0.0
But it's not good enough.,0.0
My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.,0.0
We need to do more and better.,0.0
"No, there's no difference on that.",0.0
"There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant.",0.0
I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.,0.0
I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that's the role of goverment to encourage that.,0.0
"In terms of in response to the question, no.",0.0
Can I comment on that?,0.0
"It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.",0.0
"But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.",0.0
"And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.",0.0
We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.,1.0
We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.,1.0
"Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.",1.0
It's not good enough.,0.0
Too many people have been left behind.,0.0
We have got to do much more.,0.0
"And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security.",0.0
"I'm totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market.",0.0
"I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.",0.0
Two points.,0.0
"One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.",0.0
"I remember the vice president saying, ""Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts.""",1.0
It didn't happen.,1.0
They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.,0.0
"Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget.",0.0
The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.,0.0
That means he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion.,0.0
"This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people.",0.0
"His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents.",0.0
"We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.",0.0
"If I could respond, Jim.",0.0
"What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that's not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that it's printed on.",0.0
"Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration.",0.0
In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.,0.0
"It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.",0.0
"Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.",0.0
But that's not the question.,0.0
"The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today?",0.0
I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.,0.0
It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President.,0.0
I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.,0.0
I'm not going to be a picker and chooser.,0.0
What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.,0.0
"Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses.",0.0
Here is my plan.,0.0
I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt.,0.0
And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security.,0.0
That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years.,0.0
"Now, I think that it's very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time.",0.0
Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth.,0.0
And you talk about cutting benefits.,0.0
I don't go along with it.,0.0
I am opposed to it.,0.0
I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund.,0.0
Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year.,0.0
"The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.",0.0
"His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing.",0.0
It would borrow up to $3 trillion.,0.0
"Now, Social Security has never done that.",0.0
And I don't think it should do that.,0.0
"I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I'll tell you this.",0.0
I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.,0.0
"I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn't want you to know what he's doing is loading up IOUs for future generations.",0.0
He puts no real assets into the Social Security system.,0.0
The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.,0.0
"For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear.",1.0
A promise made will be a promise kept.,1.0
You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.,0.0
That's the difference of opinion.,0.0
The vice president thinks it's the government's money.,0.0
The payroll taxes are your money.,0.0
"You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.",0.0
The money stays within the Social Security system.,0.0
It's a part of the Social Security system.,0.0
"It's your money, it's a part of your retirement benefit.",0.0
It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.,0.0
I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.,0.0
That you can pass on from one generation to the next.,0.0
I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today.,0.0
"Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.",0.0
"I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security.",0.0
My plan is Social Security plus.,0.0
The governor's plan is Social Security minus.,0.0
Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that's diverted into the stock market.,0.0
"If you make bad investments, that's too bad.",0.0
But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.,0.0
That's how it works.,0.0
And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year.,0.0
"If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.",0.0
"I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?",0.0
There's enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security.,0.0
The trillion comes from the surplus.,0.0
Surplus is money -- more money than needed.,0.0
Let me tell you what your plan is.,0.0
"It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt.",0.0
You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs.,1.0

"She said, sweetheart -- as she's prone to call me -- remember, be positive and know that I will love you no matter what you're opponent says about you.",0.0
"Well, Mom, as always, that was both reassuring and wise.",0.0
I am going to be positive tonight.,0.0
I'm not going to indulge in negative personal attacks.,0.0
"I'm going to talk about the issues that matter to the people of this country; education, health care, retirement security and moral values.",0.0

"We understand that balancing the budget, keeping America out of debt is a way to keep interest rates down and the economy growing.",0.0
"And I'm delighted to be here tonight with you, Joe.",0.0
I too want to avoid any personal attacks.,0.0
I promise not to bring up your singing.,0.0
Good.,0.0
I think this is an extraordinarily important decision we'll make on November 7th.,1.0
"We're really going to choose between what I consider to be an old way of governing ourselves of high levels of spending, high taxes, ever more intrusive bureaucracy or a new course, a new era, if you will.",0.0
And Governor Bush and I want to offer that new course of action.,0.0
"With respect to the surplus, Bernie, we have to make some kind of forecast.",0.0
We can't make 12-month decisions in this business.,0.0
We're talking about the kinds of fundamental changes in programs and government that are going to affect people's lives for the next 25 or 30 years.,0.0
"And while it may be a little risky in some respects from an economic standpoint to try to forecast surpluses, I think we have to make some planning assumption to proceed.",0.0
"We haven't moved aggressively on Social Security, on Medicare.",0.0
There are important issues out there that need to be resolved.,0.0
It's important for us to get on with that business.,0.0
That's what Governor Bush and I want to do.,0.0
"Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory.",0.0
"I'm a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools.",0.0
We believe very much in the public school system.,0.0
"But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams.",0.0
Almost no progress on math.,0.0
The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as itâ€™s ever been.,0.0
"We've had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results.",0.0
We've graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who can't read at a significant level.,1.0
They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure.,1.0
We think we know how to do it.,0.0
Governor Bush has done it in Texas.,0.0
"We want to emphasize local control so that people here in Danville, KY decide what is best for their kids.",0.0
We want to insist on high standards.,0.0
"One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of their ethnic background or income level, we don't have the same kind of expectations from you that we have from everybody else.",0.0
We want accountability.,0.0
We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we're making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives.,0.0
We think it's extraordinarily important.,0.0
Probably the single most important issue in this campaign.,0.0
Governor Bush has made it clear that when he's elected this will be his number one priority as a legislative measure to submit to the Congress.,0.0
Al Gore and I are committed to making America's public schools the best in the world.,0.0
I disagree with what my opponent has said.,0.0
A lot of progress has been made in recent years.,0.0
"Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents, teachers and administrators all around America.",0.0
There is more to be done.,0.0
"If you'll allow me, I want to go back to your last question.",0.0
It leads to this question.,0.0
"I think both of us agree that leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there's $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years.",0.0
As I said before we're being fiscally responsible about it.,0.0
We're taking $300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund.,0.0
There's a big difference between these two tickets.,0.0
Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively.,0.0
We're saving money to invest in education.,0.0
You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money.,0.0
Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose.,0.0
"To recruit 100,000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms.",0.0
To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms.,1.0
And we're not just going to stop at high school.,0.0
"We're going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to $10,000 a year in the cost of college tuition.",0.0
"Now, that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education and allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hi-tech economy of today.",1.0
"This is a very important issue, Bernie.",0.0
Maybe we could extend on education for a moment.,0.0
Yes.,0.0
"Thank you, sir.",0.0
"Your honor, do I have a chance to respond?",0.0
"If you look at our proposal, we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for Social Security.",0.0
"We take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as Medicare reform and education, several of these other key programs we want to support.",0.0
And we take roughly one-fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the American taxpayer.,0.0
It is a fundamental difference between our two approaches.,0.0
"If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign.",0.0
The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible.,0.0
Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isn't true.,0.0
Another way to look at it is over the course of the next ten years we'll collect roughly $25 trillion in revenue.,0.0
We want to take about 5% of that and return that to the American taxpayer in the form of tax relief.,0.0
We have the highest level of taxation now we've had since World War II.,0.0
"The average American family is paying about 40% in federal, state and local taxes.",0.0
"We think it is appropriate to return to the American people so that they can make choices themselves in how that money ought to be spent; whether on education, retirement or on paying their bills.",0.0
It is their choice and it is their prerogative.,0.0
We want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves and we think this is a totally reasonable approach.,0.0
Let me start with the numbers.,0.0
"With all due respect, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that Dick Cheney has just referred to are the estimates of the partisan Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee.",0.0
We're using the numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.,0.0
We start with an agreement which is this surplus in the Social Security fund should be locked up and used for Social Security.,0.0
That's where the agreement ends.,0.0
"In fact, they raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for, well, their tax cut and other programs that they can't afford because they've spent so much on the tax cut.",0.0
Let me come back to the remaining $1.8 trillion that we both talked about.,0.0
"The numbers show that $1.6 trillion goes to the big tax cut which, as Al Gore said the other night, sends 43% to the top 1%.",0.0
"Worse than that, when you add on the other spending programs that our opponents have committed to, plus the cost of their plan to privatize Social Security, by our calculations they're $1.1 trillion in debt.",0.0
"Because when interest rates go up, so, too, do the cost of mortgage payments, car payments, student loans, credit card transactions.",0.0
"So if we've learned anything over the last eight years, it is that one of the most important things the government can do, the federal government, probably the most important, is to be fiscally responsible.",0.0
And that's why Al Gore and I are committed to balancing the budget every year.,0.0
It's a good and important question.,0.0
"Obviously in our time, fortunately, great advances have been made by women achieving the kind of equality that they were too long denied.",0.0
"Bernie, your question is absolutely right.",0.0
Women -- actually the number I have received 72 cents for every $1 a man receives in a comparable job.,0.0
Al Gore and I have issued an economic plan in which we've stated specific goals for the future.,0.0
And one of those goals is to eliminate the pay gap between men and women.,0.0
It's unfair and it's unacceptable.,0.0
And the first way we will do that is by supporting the Equal Pay Act which has been proposed in Congress which gives women the right to file legal actions against employers who are not treating them fairly and not paying them equally.,0.0
"Secondly, we're going to do everything we can using governmental support of business agencies such as the Small Business Administration to help women business owners have an opportunity to invest and begin businesses and make larger incomes themselves.",0.0
And there are other civil rights and human rights laws that I think can come to play here.,0.0
"So bottom line, this is an unfair and unacceptable situation.",0.0
"And even though, as the economy has risen in the last eight years, America's women have risen with it and received more income, until women are receiving the same amount of pay for the same job they're doing as a man receives, we've not achieved genuine equality in this country.",0.0
Al Gore and I are committed to closing that gap and achieving that equality.,0.0
In so many families women are a significant bread earner or the only bread earner.,1.0
"So this cause affects not only the women, but families and the children as well.",0.0
It's not just about the differential with respect to women.,0.0
"If you look at our opponent's tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home.",0.0
"You, in effect, as a stay-at-home mom get no tax advantage under the Gore tax plan as contrasted with the Bush proposal.",0.0
"It's important to understand the things we're trying to change and address in the course of the campaign and what our agenda is for the future, our plans are for the future, focus very much about giving as much control as we can to individual Americans, be they men or women, be they single or married, as much control as possible over their own lives, especially in the area of taxation.",0.0
We want to make certain that the American people have the ability to keep more of what they earn and then they can get to decide how to spend it.,0.0
"The proposal we have from Al Gore, basically, doesn't do that.",0.0
"Bottom line, though, is 50 million American taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the Gore tax proposal, whereas under the Bush plan everybody who pays taxes will get tax relief.",0.0
Might I have an opportunity to respond?,0.0
Depends on what he says.,0.0
This is an important difference between us.,0.0
"The first thing is the tax relief program that we've proposed, one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society.",0.0
We want you to have that tax credit.,0.0
"Second, the number of 50 million Americans not benefitting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong.",0.0
It's an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it's just plain wrong.,0.0
"And secondly, although Governor Bush says that his tax cut program, large as it is, gives a tax cut to everybody, as the newspapers indicated earlier this week, the Joint Committee on Taxation, again a nonpartisan group in Congress, says that 27 million Americans don't get what the governor said they would in the tax program.",0.0
Al Gore and I want to live within our means.,0.0
We're focusing our tax cut on the middle class in the areas they tell us they need it.,0.0
The tax deduction I talked about earlier.,0.0
"Very exciting deduction for up to $10,000 a year in the cost of a college tuition.",0.0
"A $3,000 tax credit for the cost -- well, actually for a family member who stays home with a parent or grandparent who is ill. And a very exciting tax credit program that I hope I'll have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life and any time in life by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year.",0.0
"Very briefly, if a young couple making $50,000 a year saves $1,000, the government will put another $1,000 in that account.",0.0
"By the time they retire, they'll not only have guaranteed Social Security, but more than $200,000 in that retirement fund.",0.0
You have to be a CPA to understand what he just said.,0.0
The fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinary American is never going to ever figure out what they even qualify for.,1.0
"It's a classic example of wanting to have a program, in this case a tax program, that will, in fact, direct people to live their lives in certain ways rather than empowering them to make decisions for themselves.",0.0
It is a big difference between us.,0.0
"They like tax credits, we like tax reform and tax cuts.",0.0
It's unconfirmed.,0.0
The encouraging news is that the state news agency is reporting that Mr. Kostunica is the president-elect.,0.0
That is a very happy ending to a terrible story.,1.0
It's the end of a reign of terror.,1.0
"If that is not confirmed and does not happen, then I think the United States, with its European allies, ought to do everything we can to encourage the people of Serbia to do exactly what they've been doing over the last few days to rise up and end this reign of terror by Milosevic, and bring themselves back into the family of nations where they will be welcomed by the United States and others.",1.0
"You know, I'm very proud on this night as it appears that Milosevic is about to or has fallen, of the leadership role the United States played in the effort to stop his aggression and genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo.",0.0
I know our opponents have said they thought it was overreaching.,0.0
It wasn't.,0.0
It was a matter of principle in America's national interest and values.,0.0
"And, in fact, made the United States more respected and trusted by our allies and more feared by our enemies.",0.0
"I think that Vice President Gore played a critical role, passionate purposive role in leading the administration, along with Republican supporters like Bob Dole and John McCain, to do the right thing in the Balkans.",0.0
And hopefully tonight we're seeing the final results of that bold and brave effort.,0.0
I hope it marks the end of Milosevic.,0.0
I think probably more than anything else it's a victory for the Serbian people.,0.0
"They've taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote.",0.0
In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia.,0.0
"We saw it in Germany, we saw it in Rumania, we saw it in Czechoslovakia, as the people of eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom.",0.0
And I think we all admire that.,0.0
"I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic's departure.",0.0
"Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U. S. troops.",0.0
I do think it's noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the Russians involved.,0.0
"I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night at the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians.",0.0
He has supported the administration on Kosovo.,0.0
He's been supportive of the policy that we've seen with respect to Yugoslavia.,0.0
And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that.,0.0
I would go beyond that.,0.0
I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia.,1.0
And it's a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union.,1.0
One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe.,0.0
My preference is to deploy them as warriors.,0.0
"There may be occasion when it's appropriate to use them in a peacekeeping role, but I think the role ought to be limited, there ought to be a time limit on it.",0.0
The reason we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars.,0.0
And to maintain with sufficient strength so that would-be adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place.,0.0
"I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility.",0.0
We've seen a reduction in our forces far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the Cold War.,0.0
At the same time we've seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon.,0.0
"For example General Mike Ryan of the Air Force with 40% fewer aircraft, he's now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously.",0.0
This has had some other unfortunate effects.,0.0
"I saw a letter the other day from a young captain stationed in Fort Bragg, a graduate of West Point in '95 getting ready to get out of the service because he's only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year.",0.0
He's concerned that if he had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost.,0.0
"That is a legitimate concern, this is a very important area.",1.0
"Major responsibility for us in the future, a high priority for myself and Governor Bush to rebuild the U. S. military and to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and give them good leadership.",0.0
I am.,0.0
"I want to assure the American people that the American military is the best-trained, best-equipped, most powerful force in the world.",0.0
And that Al Gore and I will do whatever it takes to keep them that way.,0.0
The fact is that you've got to judge the military by what the military leaders say.,0.0
"The fact is, judging by its results from Desert Storm to the Balkans, Bosnia and Kosovo, to the operations that are still being conducted to keep Saddam Hussein in a box in Iraq, the American military has performed brilliantly.",0.0
We passed the largest pay increase in a generation for our military.,0.0
"And the interesting fact here, in spite of the rhetoric that my opponent has just spoken, the reality is if you look at our projected budgets for the next ten years, Al Gore and I actually commit twice as much, $100 billion in additional funding for our military than Governor Bush does.",0.0
"Bernie, this is a special interest of mine.",0.0
"I would like a chance to elaborate further, if I might.",0.0
The facts are dramatically different.,0.0
"I'm not attacking the military, Joe.",0.0
I have enormous regard for the men and women of the U. S. military.,1.0
I had the privilege of working with them for the four years I was the Secretary of Defense.,0.0
No one has a higher regard than I do for them.,0.0
"If you have friends and relatives serving in the U. S. military, you know there's a problem.",0.0
Significant problems of retention.,0.0
The important thing for us to remember is that we're a democracy and we're defended by volunteers.,0.0
"Everybody out there tonight wearing the uniform, standing on guard to protect the United States is there because they volunteered to put on a uniform.",0.0
That's an extraordinarily valuable trust.,0.0
"There is no more important responsibility for a President of the United States than his role as Commander in Chief, and the obligation he undertakes on behalf o fall of us when he decides when to send our young men and women to war.",0.0
"When we send them without the right kind of training, when we send them poorly equipped or with equipment that's old and broken down, we put their lives at risk.",0.0
We will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we don't look to those basic fundamental problems now.,0.0
"With all due respect this administration has a bad track record in this regard, and it's available for anybody who wants to look at the record and wants to talk to our men and women in uniform, and wants to spend time with the members of the Joint Chiefs, wants to look at readiness levels and other -- other indicators.",0.0
"Final point, the issue of procurement is very important because we're running now off the buildup of the investment we made during the Reagan years.",0.0
"As that equipment gets old, it has to be replaced.",0.0
We've taken money out of the procurement budget to support other ventures.,0.0
"Yes, of course it's an important debate to have as part of this campaign, but I don't want either the military to feel uneasy or the American people to feel insecure.",0.0
"What I'm saying now I'm basing on serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee talking to exactly the people Dick Cheney has mentioned, the Secretary of Defense, the Chiefs of Staff.",0.0
I've visited our fighting forces around the world.,0.0
I'm telling you that we are ready to meet any contingency that might arise.,0.0
The good news here and the interesting news is that we have met our recruitment targets in each of the services this year.,0.0
"In fact, in the areas where our opponents have said we are overextended, such as the Balkans, the soldiers there have a higher rate of re-enlistment than anywhere else in the service because they feel a sense of purpose, a sense of mission.",0.0
"In fact, this administration has begun to transform the American military to take it away from being a Cold War force to prepare it to meet the threats of the new generation of tomorrow, of weapons of mass destruction, of ballistic missiles, terrorism, cyber warfare.",0.0
"The fact is that Governor Bush recommended in his major policy statement on the military earlier this year that we skip the next generation of military equipment; helicopters, submarines, tactical air fighters, all the rest.",0.0
That would really cripple our readiness.,0.0
Exactly the readiness that Dick Cheney is talking about.,0.0
"Al Gore and I are committed to continuing this acquisition program, transforming the military.",0.0
"There's still fewer people in uniform today, but person-to-person, person-by-person, unit-by-unit, this is the most powerful and effective military, not only in the world today, but in the history of the world.",1.0
"And again, Al Gore and I will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way.",0.0
"Yes, it is.",0.0
"I mean America has a national strategic interest and principled interest in peace in the Middle East, and Al Gore has played a critical role in advancing that process over the last eight years.",0.0
"That these two peoples have come in some senses, generations forward, centuries forward, in the last seven years.",0.0
"They are so close to a final peace agreement, I hope and pray that the death and unrest in the last week will not create the kinds of scars that make it hard for them to go back to the peace table with American assistance and achieve what I'm convinced the great majority of the Israeli and Palestinian people want, and indeed these people throughout the Middle East, which is peace.",0.0
Secretary Albright has been in Paris meeting with prime minister Barak and chairman Arafat.,0.0
"I hope and pray her mission is successful, that there is a cease fire, and the parties return to the peace table.",0.0
"I hope I might, through my friendships in Israel and throughout the Arab world, play a unique role in bringing peace to this -- this sacred region of the world.",0.0
"Bernie, it has been a very, very difficult area to work in for a long time.",0.0
Numerous administrations going back certainly to World War II have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East.,1.0
"We made significant breakthroughs, I think, at the end of the Bush administration because of the Gulf War.",0.0
"In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces.",0.0
"By virtue of the end of the Cold War, the Soviets were no longer a factor.",0.0
They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East.,1.0
I think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like Yitzak Rabin.,0.0
"His tragic passing was of great consequence, a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the Middle East.",0.0
He was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the Israelis to take risks for peace.,0.0
I hope that we can get this resolved as soon as possible.,0.0
My guess is the next administration is going to be the one that is going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there.,0.0
"I think it's very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people, of keeping his word so friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us.",0.0
We might have no other choice.,1.0
We'll have to see if that happens.,1.0
"The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military.",1.0
"We had put them back in the box, so to speak.",0.0
"We had a strong international coalition raid against them, effective economic sanctions, and a very robust inspection regime was in place under the U. N. auspices and it was able to do a good job of stripping out the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction, the work he had been doing that had not been destroyed during the war in biological and chemical agents, as well as a nuclear program.",1.0
"Unfortunately now we find ourselves in a situation where that started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together.",0.0
"Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf States, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad.",0.0
I also think it's unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we don't know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq.,0.0
"I certainly hope he's not regenerating that kind of capability, but if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to -- to stop that activity.",0.0
I don't think you can afford to have a man like Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons in the Middle East.,0.0
"It would, of course, be a very serious situation if we had evidence, credible evidence, that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction.",1.0
"I must say, I don't think a political campaign is the occasion to declare exactly what we would do in that case.",0.0
"I think that's a matter of such critical national security importance that it ought to be left to the Commander in Chief, leaders of the military, Secretary of State to make that kind of decision without the heat of a political campaign.",0.0
The fact is that we will not enjoy real stability in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein is gone.,0.0
The Gulf War was a great victory.,0.0
"And incidentally, Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war.",0.0
"But, the war did not end with a total victory.",0.0
Saddam Hussein remained there.,0.0
"As a result, we have had almost ten years now of instability.",0.0
We have continued to operate almost all of this time military action to enforce a no-fly zone.,0.0
The Vice President met with them earlier this year.,0.0
"We are supporting them in their efforts and will continue to support them until the Iraqi people rise up and do what the people of Serbia have done in the last few days, get rid of a despot.",1.0
We'll welcome you back into the family of nations where you belong.,1.0
"Not enough, but this administration and Vice President Gore and I have had both a long-term strategy to develop energy independence and a short-term strategy.",0.0
Aimed at a partnership for a new generation of vehicles with the American automobile industry which is making great progress and can produce a vehicle that can get 80 miles per gallon.,0.0
We also have a short-term strategy.,0.0
To deal with exactly the kind of ups and downs of energy prices.,0.0
We aren't going to lay back and let them roll over our economy.,0.0
We did it also because gasoline prices were rising and home heating oil inventories were real low.,0.0
"Both of our tickets agree on LIHEAP keeping the low income housing assistance program, but our opponents offer no assistance to middle-class families hit by rising gas prices and a shortage of home heating oil.",0.0
The fact is that since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel.,0.0
That's a good result and I'm proud of it.,0.0
My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today.,0.0
"That as a nation, we are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues.",0.0
We have the prospects of brownouts in California.,0.0
We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast.,0.0
We have gasoline price rises in various other places.,0.0
"For years now the administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil, but they haven't done it.",0.0
"In fact, we've gone exactly in the opposite direction.",0.0
We have the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years.,0.0
You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today.,0.0
Our imports are at an all-time record high.,0.0
That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price.,0.0
We have other problems.,0.0
We don't have refinery capacity.,0.0
We haven't built a new refinery in this country for over ten years.,0.0
Even with more crude available they're probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter.,1.0
That will allways be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction.,0.0
We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home.,0.0
We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it very safely in an environmentally sound manner.,0.0
We don't think we ought to buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment.,0.0
We can.,0.0
We have the technology to do it and we ought to do it.,0.0
We do support the low income energy assistance program.,0.0
"We think it's important that senior citizens don't suffer this winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this administration hasn't produced them.",0.0
I yield.,0.0
I think we have to make choices.,0.0
"The Wyoming wilderness bill, frankly was one of my proudest achievements as a member of Congress.",0.0
I worked on that with my good friend Al Simpson for about four years.,0.0
"We set aside a part of Wyoming, nearly a million acres of wilderness that ought to be separate and not be developed.",1.0
We think that was important.,0.0
There are a lot of areas around the country where Governor Bush and I support restraint.,0.0
"For example we support the moratorium on drilling off the coast of California, but there are places where we think we ought to go forward and develop those resources.",0.0
The Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is one of them.,0.0
It's on the north slope right next to Prudhoe Bay.,0.0
The infrastructure is there to be able to deliver that product to market.,0.0
"We think we can do it given today's technology in a way that will not damage the environment, will not permanently marr the countryside at all, and so what we're looking for with respect to environmental policy and energy policy is balance.",0.0
"We do have to make choices, we recognize that.",0.0
"The way you phrased the question, frankly I welcome because it shows, in fact, we are trying to pursue a balanced approach and the suggestion that somehow all we care about is energy development isn't true.",0.0
But we do have to get on with developing those resources or we're going to find ourselves ever more dependent on foreign sources.,0.0
We're going to find that the fact that we don't have an energy policy out there is one of the major storm clouds on the horizon for our economy.,0.0
"Bernie, we agree on the problem but we couldn't disagree more on the response to the problem.",0.0
The problem is accurately stated.,0.0
"No matter how strong we are economically, if we remain dependent on a source of energy that is outside our control, we're not going to be as strong as we should be.",0.0
"Others around the world can effectively yank our chain, and we cannot allow that to continue to happen.",0.0
"I'm afraid that our opponent's response to this is one-sided, and it is essentially to develop the resources within the United States almost regardless of where.",0.0
I'm against drilling in the Arctic Refuge.,0.0
"This is one of the most beautiful, pristine places that the good Lord has created on earth.",0.0
"It's not worth it to do that for what seems to be the possibility of six months' worth of oil, seven to 12 years from now.",0.0
That's not much of a response to the immediate problem that gasoline consumers and home heating oil customers are facing this winter.,0.0
There are more resources within the United States that we can develop.,0.0
This isn't mentioned much and appreciated much.,0.0
The administration has encouraged the drilling for deep gas and oil going on in the western Gulf today.,0.0
The answer here is new technology that will create millions of new jobs.,0.0
Let me just say this.,0.0
"If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars we'll get a -- we'll save 1 million barrels of oil a day, which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produce.",0.0
The choice to me is clear.,0.0
"We have to develop fuel cells, alternative energy, encourage people to conserve and to be efficient.",0.0
"Yes, indeed.",0.0
I can pledge to the American people categorically that no one will lose benefits under our plan for Social Security as far forward as 2054.,0.0
"And let me come back and say, Bernie, that Al Gore and I view Social Security as probably the best thing the government did in the second half -- the last century.",0.0
"It has created a floor under which seniors cannot fall, and so many of them depend on it for their basic living, for their livelihood.",0.0
It's critically important to protect it.,0.0
"That's why Al and I have committed to putting that Social Security surplus in a lockbox, not touching it.",0.0
That's what allows us to keep Social Security solvent to 2054.,0.0
Our opponents have an idea for privatizing Social Security that will jeopardize Social Security payments to recipients.,0.0
And I looked at this idea.,0.0
For a while I was drilling into this idea of privatization of Social Security.,0.0
It requires taking as much as a trillion dollars out of the Social Security fund.,0.0
"The independent analysts have said that would put the fund out of money in 2023, or if it's not out of money, benefits will have to be cut by over 50%.",0.0
That's just not worth doing.,0.0
Al Gore and I are going to guarantee Social Security and add to it the retirement savings plan that I mentioned earlier which will help middle-class families looking forward.,0.0
The Social Security system is in trouble.,0.0
It's been a fantastic program and has been there for 65 years that has provided benefits for senior citizens over that period of time.,1.0
For my parents.,0.0
It means a great deal to millions of Americans.,0.0
"And Governor Bush and I want to make absolutely certain that the first thing we do is guarantee the continuation of those payments, those benefits and keep those promises that were made.",0.0
"That's because the demographics that work out there, it's almost an iron law.",0.0
"The reform we would like to offer is to allow our young people to begin to take a portion of the payroll tax, 2% of it, and invest it in a personal retirement account.",0.0
That does several things.,0.0
"First of all, it gives them a stake in the Social Security system.",0.0
That becomes their property.,0.0
They own it.,0.0
They can pass it on to their kids if they want.,0.0
They don't have that kind of equity in Social Security today.,0.0
"Secondly, we can generate a higher return off that investment than you get in the existing system.",0.0
Today you get about a 2% return of what you pay into Social Security.,0.0
At least three times what we're able to get now.,0.0
"And long-term by generating a bigger return, we'll put additional funds into the system that will help us survive that crunch that is otherwise going to hit in the future.",0.0
Bottom line is there's a choice here.,0.0
"With respect to Al Gore and Joe's plan, they don't reform Social Security.",0.0
They add another huge obligation on top of it that future generations will have to pay.,0.0
They don't reform it and don't save it.,0.0
We have a plan to do that and a plan to give our young people a choice and more control over their own lives.,0.0
"Well, I think there are a number of ways to do it.",0.0
"First of all, I agree with your assessment.",0.0
I have a different perspective on Washington than I had when I was there in the past.,0.0
"I'm proud of my service for 25 years, but also proud I had the opportunity to go out and get a different experience.",0.0
And you're absolutely right.,0.0
People are fed up.,1.0
They've had enough with the bickering and the partisanship that seems to characterize the debate that goes on in the nation's capital.,1.0
I've seen it done differently though.,0.0
I've watched George Bush.,0.0
He came in when he had a legislature completely controlled by the other party.,0.0
"He managed to reach across partisan lines and unite republicans, and democrats and independents and put them to work to achieve good things for the State of Texas.",0.0
Partly because he didn't point the finger of blame looking for scapegoats he was quick to share the credit.,1.0
It's possible to change the tone.,0.0
It is possible to get people to work together and to begin to focus on achieving results.,0.0
"I don't think you can do it, with all due respect to Al Gore, with somebody who spent all the last 24 years in that Washington environment and who campaigns on the basis of castigating others, pointing the finger of blame at others in terms of blaming business or various groups for failings.",0.0
I think you have to be able to reach out and work together and build coalitions.,0.0
I think George W. Bush has done it in Texas and can do it at the national level.,0.0
You're absolutely right.,0.0
There's too much partisanship in Washington.,0.0
It puzzles me.,0.0
"You think people in public life and politics would want to do what would make them popular, and too often people in both parties act in a way that brings down the institutions of government, and each of us individually, and it's a shame.",0.0
I have tried very hard in my career to call them as I see them and work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get things done.,0.0
"I'm proud of my record in that regard, and I certainly think that would be an asset that I could bring to the vice presidency should I be fortunate enough to be elected.",0.0
I worked with John McCain on cultural values.,0.0
I worked with Connie Mack on foreign policy.,0.0
Don Nichols on the International Religious Freedom Act.,0.0
If I go on much longer I'll get in trouble with my own party.,0.0
That's the way things get done.,0.0
I'm proud of those partnerships.,0.0
Let me say a word about Al Gore.,0.0
"In his years in the house and Senate, he formed similar bipartisan partnerships.",0.0
"If you look back over the last eight years, the most significant accomplishments of this administration in which Al Gore was centrally involved were the result, most of them, of bipartisan agreements.",1.0
"After all, the Welfare Reform Act, which Al Gore promised to lead the effort on to get people off of welfare to set time limits, to get people to enjoy the dignity of work.",1.0
That was a bipartisan act that was adopted.,1.0
"The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which was critical to getting our economy to the point and our government to the point of unprecedented surplus we enjoy today also was bipartisan, and Al Gore was involved.",1.0
I would say that's exactly the kind of bipartisan leadership that he and I can bring to Washington to get things done.,0.0
"With all due respect, Joe, there's an awful lot of evidence that there hasn't been any bipartisan leadership out of this administration or Al Gore.",0.0
The fact is the Medicare problems have not been addressed.,1.0
The educational problem has not been addressed.,1.0
They've been in a position of responsibility in the White House.,0.0
Dick Cheney must be one of the few people who think nothing has been accomplished in the last eight years.,0.0
Promises were made and promises were kept.,0.0
Absolutely.,0.0
Did he deliver?,0.0
Big time.,0.0
If I may put it that way.,0.0
That's the record.,0.0
Look at the 20 -- look at the 22 million new jobs.,0.0
Look at the 4 million new businesses.,0.0
"Look at the lower interest rates, low rate of inflation, high rate of growth.",0.0
"I think if you asked most people in America today that famous question that Ronald Reagan asked, ""Are you better off today than you were eight years ago? """,0.0
"I'm pleased to see, Dick, from the newspapers that you're better off than you were eight years ago, too.",0.0
"I can tell you, Joe, the government had absolutely nothing to do with it.",0.0
"I can see my wife and I think she's thinking, ""I wish he would go out into the private sector.""",0.0
"I think you've done so well there, I want to keep you there.",0.0
It is such an assault on the basic promise that America makes that the law will treat individuals as individuals regardless of their status.,1.0
And the sad fact is that racial profiling occurs in this country.,0.0
We can't tolerate it anymore.,1.0
Because it's the most we could get done to do hard studies to make the case of the extent to which racial profiling is occurring in our country.,0.0
But it's also why I'm so proud that Al Gore said two things.,0.0
"First we would issue, if we're fortunate enough to be elected, an executive order prohibiting racial profiling.",0.0
And secondly the first Civil Rights Act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling.,0.0
It is just wrong.,0.0
"It is unAmerican, and to think that in the 21st Century this kind of nonsense is still going on.",1.0
The only way to stop it is through the law.,0.0
"The law, after all, is meant to express our values and our aspirations for our society.",0.0
And our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exists.,0.0
"I had a friend a while ago who works in the government, works at the White House, African-American, stopped, surrounded by police for no other cause that anyone can determine than the color of his skin.",1.0
That can't be in America anymore.,1.0
"Bernie, I would like to answer your question to the best of my ability, but I don't think I can understand fully what it would be like.",0.0
It has to be a horrible experience.,0.0
"The sense of anger and frustration and rage that go with knowing that the only reason you were stopped, the only reason you were arrested, was because of the color of your skin would make me extraordinarily angry, and I'm not sure how I would respond.",0.0
"We still have not only the problems we're talking about here tonight in terms of the problems you mentioned in profiling, but beyond that, we still have an achievement gap in education, income differentials, differences in life span.",0.0
"I think in terms of equality of opportunity, that we judge people as individuals.",0.0
"As Martin Luther King said, we ought to judge people on the content of their character instead of the color of their skin.",0.0
I would hope we can continue to make progress int that regard in the years ahead.,0.0
We clearly come from different political perspectives.,0.0
"Joe is a Democrat from New England, I'm a Republican from the west, from Wyoming.",0.0
And I think that weighs into it to some extent.,0.0
Clearly we're both in the positions we're in because of our personal relationships with our principals.,0.0
I think the areas that I would bring are the things that Governor Bush emphasized when he picked me.,0.0
"Served as Secretary of Defense, and then had significant experience in the private sector.",0.0
"I think that where there are differences between Joe and myself in terms of background and experience, I clearly have spent a lot of time in executive positions running large organizations both in private business as well as in government.",0.0
I'll leave it at that.,0.0
I have great respect for Dick Cheney.,0.0
I don't agree with a lot of things he said in this campaign.,0.0
"He was a very distinguished Secretary of Defense, and I don't have anything negative to say about him.",0.0
Wanting to make a difference.,0.0
"And for the last 12 years as a member of the Senate of the United States focusing on national security questions, environmental protection, economic growth and values.",0.0
But perhaps what I most bring is a friendship and shared values and shared priorities with Al Gore.,0.0
I have tremendous respect for Al Gore.,0.0
I've known him for 15 years.,0.0
He's an outstanding person as a public official and as a private person.,0.0
His life is built on his faith.,0.0
It's devoted to his family.,0.0
He volunteered for service in Vietnam from the beginning.,0.0
As vice president I think he's been the most effective vice president in the history of the United States and he has the right program to use the prosperity all the American people have earned to help particularly hard working middle-class families raise up their children to enjoy a better life.,0.0
"I think that's what this is all about, why I'm so proud to be his running mate.",0.0
"We've been trying very hard to keep this on a high plane, Bernie.",0.0
"Thanks, Bernie.",0.0
I do have a couple of concerns where I like the old Joe Lieberman better than I do the new Joe Lieberman.,0.0
Let's see if I can put them in those terms.,0.0
And the kinds of materials that were being peddled to our children.,0.0
And many of us on the Republican side admired him for that.,0.0
"There is, I must say, the view now that having joined with Al Gore on the ticket on the other side, that the depth of conviction that we had admired before isn't quite as strong as it was, perhaps, in the past.",0.0
"The temptation on the one hand to criticize the activities of the industry, as was pointed out recently in the Federal Trade Commission where they're taking clearly material meant for adults and selling it to our children, while at the same time they are participating in fundraising events with some of the people responsible for that activity has been a source of concern for many of us.",0.0
"We were especially disturbed, Joe, at a recent fundraiser you attended where there was a comedian that got up and criticized George Bush's religion.",0.0
I know you're not responsible for having uttered any words of criticism of his religion.,0.0
"Bernie, you'll not be surprised to hear that I disagree.",0.0
First let me talk about that joke about religion which I found very distasteful.,1.0
"And believe me, if anybody has devoted his life to respecting the role of religion in American life and understands that Americans from the beginning of our history have turned to God for strength and purpose, it's me.",0.0
I thought that humor was unacceptable.,0.0
Let me come to the question of Hollywood and then answer the general question.,0.0
"Al Gore and I have felt for a long time, first as parents and then only second as public officials, that we cannot let America's parents stand alone in this competition that they feel they're in with Hollywood to raise their own kids and give their kids the faith and values they want to give them.",0.0
I've been a consistent crusader on that behalf.,1.0
John McCain and I actually requested the Federal Trade Commission report that came out three or four weeks ago which proved conclusively that the entertainment industry was marketing adult-rated products to our children.,0.0
One finding was that they were actually using 10 to 12-year-olds to test screen adult-rated products.,0.0
"When that report came out, Al Gore and I said to the entertainment industry, stop it.",0.0
"If you don't stop it in six months, we'll ask the Federal Trade Commission to take action against you.",0.0
There was no similar strong response from our opponents.,0.0
We repeated that message when we went to Los Angeles.,0.0
I repeat it today.,0.0
Al Gore and I -- I'm out.,0.0
Maybe I can come back to it.,0.0
"Al Gore and I agree on most everything, but we disagree on some things.",0.0
And I have not changed a single position since Al Gore nominated me to be his vice president.,0.0
That went very quickly.,0.0
"Thank you, Bernie, and thanks, Dick Cheney, for a very good debate.",0.0
I'm told tens of millions of people have been watching this debate tonight.,0.0
"I must say, I wish one more person were here to watch and that is my dad, who died 15 years ago.",0.0
"If my dad were here, I would have the opportunity to tell him that he was right when he taught me that in America, if you have faith, work hard and play by the rules, there is nothing you cannot achieve.",0.0
And here I am even the son of a man who started working the night shift on a bakery truck can end up being a candidate for Vice President of the United States.,0.0
"That says a lot about the character of this nation and the goodness of you, the American people.",0.0
Trying so hard to teach their kids right from wrong and believing in their hearts that their kids can make it.,0.0
I agree with them.,0.0
"But to make it they need a leader who will stand up and fight for them for good education, the best education in the world.",0.0
"For a sound retirement system, for prescription drug benefits for their parents.",0.0
"And for a government that is fiscally responsible, balances the budget.",0.0
"You know, for 224 years Americans have dreamed bigger dreams and tried bolder solutions than any other people on earth.",0.0
Now is not the time to settle for less than we can be.,0.0
"As good as things are today, Al Gore and I believe that with your help and God's help we can make the future of this good and blessed country even better.",0.0
"Thank you, God bless you and good night.",0.0
"Bernie, I want to thank you and Joe as well.",0.0
I've enjoyed the debate this evening.,0.0
"We want to reform the Medicare system to make certain the benefits are there for our senior citizens, but also to provide prescription drug coverage for them and give them a range of choices in terms of the kind of insurance we have.",0.0
We want to reform the education system.,0.0
We want to restore our public schools to the greatness they once represented so that every parent has the opportunity to choose what is best for their child and so that every child has an opportunity to share in the American dream.,0.0
We also want to reform the tax code.,0.0
"We think it's very important now that we have a surplus, that a portion of that surplus go back to the people who earned it.",0.0
"It's not the government's money, it's your money.",1.0
"You're entitled to it, and we would like to see to it that we provide tax relief for everybody who pays taxes.",1.0
"Finally, we think it's very important to rebuild the U. S. military.",0.0
The military is in trouble.,0.0
The trends are in the wrong direction.,0.0
The finest men and women in uniform that you'll find anyplace in the world but they deserve our support.,0.0
They deserve the resources that we need to provide for them and they deserve good leadership.,0.0
George Bush is the man to do this.,0.0
I've seen him do it in Texas.,0.0
What we need is to be able to reach across the aisle.,0.0
"George Bush is good man, an honorable man, a man of great integrity.",0.0
He will make a first rate president.,0.0
"Thank you, Bernie.",0.0
"I have, I have.",0.0
First question is what's in the best interests of the United States?,0.0
What's in the best interests of our people?,0.0
When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.,0.0
Is it in our nation's interests?,0.0
Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.,0.0
Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.,0.0
Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.,0.0
I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.,0.0
"I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy.",0.0
"I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.",0.0
He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him.,0.0
He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.,0.0
One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.,0.0
I've been able to set clear goals.,0.0
"The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.",0.0
That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.,0.0
So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.,0.0
"Yes, Jim.",0.0
"I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.",0.0
I see it as a question of values.,0.0
It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.,0.0
And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.,0.0
"It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.",0.0
"As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom.",0.0
So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.,0.0
The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.,1.0
"And that means, for example, standing up for human rights.",1.0
"It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential.",1.0
So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.,0.0
We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.,0.0
And we have to keep our military strong.,0.0
"We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.",1.0
"But our real power comes, I think, from our values.",0.0
"Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed.",0.0
I don't think they'll look at us with envy.,0.0
It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.,0.0
"If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us.",0.0
"If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.",0.0
And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.,0.0
So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.,0.0
"We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us.",0.0
I agree with that.,0.0
"I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway.",1.0
So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.,0.0
But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.,0.0
We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.,0.0
"That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.",0.0
"You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time.",1.0
The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.,0.0
We need to do more.,0.0
But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.,0.0
"Yes, it does.",0.0
"Take, for example, Third World debt.",0.0
I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.,0.0
"I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.",0.0
"We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people.",0.0
We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world.,0.0
We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.,0.0
So we got to be guarded in our generosity.,0.0
"The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.",0.0
We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured.,0.0
We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.,0.0
"I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.",0.0
"The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now.",1.0
It's a very tense situation there.,1.0
But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.,0.0
"It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.",0.0
Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there.,0.0
And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.,0.0
"But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.",0.0
Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives.,1.0
"They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.",1.0
And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.,0.0
"Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.",0.0
"Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.",0.0
I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.,0.0
I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend.,1.0
I'm going to stand by Israel.,1.0
"Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.",0.0
It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.,0.0
"The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.",0.0
We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction.,1.0
He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.,0.0
But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination.,0.0
"One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Husseinâ€™s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.",0.0
"It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in.",0.0
"After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing.",0.0
I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.,0.0
"Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker.",0.0
"And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us.",0.0
"And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.",0.0
"I do think this, though.",0.0
When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.,0.0
"It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.",0.0
"Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides.",0.0
"And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.",0.0
This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.,0.0
I will try to do the same thing.,0.0
"But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.",0.0
I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.,0.0
"I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.",0.0
"We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.",0.0
He is a danger.,1.0
We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.,1.0
I do.,0.0
"Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.",0.0
I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.,0.0
But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.,0.0
And we have maintained the sanctions.,0.0
Now I want to go further.,0.0
"I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions.",0.0
"I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it.",1.0
I don't think they should be allowed to.,0.0
"No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.",0.0
I think it's a triumph.,0.0
I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.,0.0
I supported them when they did so.,0.0
"I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made.",0.0
I'm pleased the president made the decision he made.,0.0
"Because freedom took hold in that part of the world, but there's a lot of work left to be done, however.",0.0
"Yes, I think it is.",0.0
Absolutely.,0.0
I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.,0.0
And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.,0.0
I supported the president.,0.0
I thought he made the right decision to do so.,0.0
"I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked.",0.0
The administration deserves credit for having made it work.,0.0
It is important for NATO to have it work.,0.0
It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.,0.0
"And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.",0.0
"Now, there's more work to do.",0.0
"Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one.",0.0
Iâ€™m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.,0.0
I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.,0.0
"Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years.",0.0
When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.,0.0
He caused the death of so many people.,0.0
He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator.,0.0
And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics.,0.0
"Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.",0.0
He is an indicted war criminal.,0.0
He should be held accountable.,0.0
"Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.",0.0
"In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U. S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U. S. ought to get involved with troops.",0.0
"But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values.",0.0
"Now, have I got that wrong?",0.0
Trying to figure out who the questioner was.,0.0
If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.,0.0
"I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took.",0.0
I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.,0.0
"I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.",0.0
Can you run through the list again?,0.0
I thought that was a mistake.,0.0
I supported that.,0.0
"Yes, I voted for it, supported it.",0.0
"Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered.",0.0
I did support it at the time.,0.0
"It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.",0.0
"Oh, yes.",0.0
Yes.,0.0
"Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission went wrong.",0.0
The mission was changed.,0.0
"And as a result, our nation paid a price.",0.0
And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.,0.0
I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.,0.0
I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.,0.0
"But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti.",0.0
I wouldn't have supported either.,0.0
"Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.",0.0
I think the administration did the right thing in that case.,0.0
"It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda.",0.0
And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.,0.0
"The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U. S. troops into Rwanda.",1.0
"I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.",0.0
"We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.",0.0
"My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.",1.0
But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.,0.0
We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.,0.0
"But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.",0.0
"If we tried everything else, if we have allies.",0.0
"In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.",0.0
In Africa we did not.,0.0
"Now, we have tried -- our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance.",0.0
"We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that.",0.0
"But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.",0.0
"Well, I understand, and Africa is important.",0.0
"And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy.",0.0
We have to work with Nigeria.,0.0
Itâ€™s an important continent.,0.0
"But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere.",0.0
"And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.",0.0
"I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.",0.0
I thought that was a good model.,0.0
"But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.",0.0
And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.,0.0
I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.,0.0
I want to be judicious in its use.,0.0
You mentioned Haiti.,0.0
I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.,0.0
I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile.,0.0
"It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful.",0.0
I don't think we agree on that.,0.0
I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.,0.0
I think we have to be very reticent about that.,0.0
"But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.",0.0
"The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together.",0.0
"Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.",0.0
All these other countries are looking to us.,0.0
"Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.",0.0
"Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here.",0.0
"This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.",0.0
"During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.",0.0
"The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II.",0.0
"And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.",0.0
We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.,0.0
We still have lots of troops in Europe.,0.0
And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's?,0.0
We were nation building.,0.0
And it was economic.,0.0
But it was also military.,0.0
And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.,0.0
We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.,0.0
First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.,0.0
I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.,0.0
And we can't do that.,0.0
We've got to rebuild our military.,0.0
But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.,0.0
"And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.",0.0
I would very much like to get our troops out of there.,0.0
"I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal.",0.0
That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.,0.0
But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.,0.0
And there is an example.,0.0
Haiti is another example.,0.0
"Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.",0.0
I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world.,0.0
The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.,0.0
I don't think so.,0.0
I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.,0.0
Maybe I'm missing something here.,0.0
"I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?",0.0
Absolutely not.,0.0
Our military is meant to fight and win war.,0.0
That's what it's meant to do.,0.0
"And when it gets overextended, morale drops.",0.0
"I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.",0.0
"And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military.",0.0
"It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.",0.0
I don't disagree with that.,0.0
"I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.",0.0
That's what we did in Haiti.,0.0
There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now.,0.0
That's really about all we can do.,0.0
"But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.",1.0
I certainly agree with that.,0.0
I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.,0.0
We've had some disagreements about that.,0.0
"He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.",0.0
But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.,0.0
And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.,0.0
"Well, I mentioned Third World debt.",0.0
"That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations.",0.0
"I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.",0.0
I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.,0.0
"I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently.",1.0
"One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.",0.0
"I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.",0.0
It needs to be available for emergency situations.,0.0
I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.,1.0
But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.,0.0
So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.,0.0
I just want to make sure the return is good.,0.0
"No, I would make some changes.",0.0
I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.,0.0
"I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.",0.0
And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.,0.0
"The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption.",0.0
The governor mentioned it earlier.,0.0
I've worked on this issue.,0.0
"It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.",0.0
And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it.,0.0
"I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history.",1.0
"The worldâ€™s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.",1.0
And we have a fundamental choice to make.,0.0
"Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader.",1.0
And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.,1.0
"I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction.",0.0
"Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.",0.0
It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.,0.0
Let me comment on that.,0.0
I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.,0.0
We can help.,0.0
"And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.",0.0
"I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.",0.0
"I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, â€œwe do it this way, so should you.â€ I think we can help.",0.0
"But take Russia, for example.",0.0
"We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.",0.0
They're going to have to make the decision themselves.,0.0
"Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.",0.0
But Russia has to make the decision.,0.0
"We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make.",0.0
"So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, â€œwe do it this way, so should you.â€ Now, we trust freedom.",0.0
"We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.",1.0
"But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.",0.0
Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.,0.0
"Yes, I would.",0.0
"The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing.",0.0
I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.,0.0
I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.,0.0
And I know it's been going on a long time.,0.0
In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years.,0.0
But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.,0.0
And I was surprised at the extent of it.,0.0
And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.,0.0
"Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.",0.0
"Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core.",0.0
And it's not an easy problem to solve.,0.0
"But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.",0.0
"Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed.",0.0
"That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.",0.0
And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.,0.0
"One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.",0.0
"I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.",0.0
"I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.",0.0
"But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.",1.0
I don't think they ought to be held guilty.,0.0
"But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.",0.0
"And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.",0.0
Yeah.,0.0
I would agree.,0.0
"And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also.",0.0
"I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.",1.0
"And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.",0.0
And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.,0.0
"And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas.",1.0
And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.,0.0
And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.,0.0
I think these crimes are different.,0.0
"I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.",0.0
"No, I don't, really.",0.0
No.,0.0
And guess what?,0.0
"The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them?",0.0
They're going to be put to death.,0.0
And it's the right cause.,0.0
It's the right decision.,0.0
"Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America.",0.0
Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.,0.0
"People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.",0.0
"My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.",0.0
So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.,0.0
It's an issue throughout our society.,0.0
"And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.",0.0
"I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.",1.0
They're tolerant people.,1.0
"They're good, tolerant people.",1.0
"It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.",0.0
Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.,0.0
In public education when we just move children through the schools.,0.0
"My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.",1.0
She had one of the greatest lines of all lines.,1.0
"She said, reading is the new civil right.",1.0
She's right.,1.0
"And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.",1.0
I mean every child.,1.0
It starts with making sure every child learns to read.,0.0
K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency.,0.0
Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.,0.0
"Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.",0.0
"I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.",0.0
We can do better in our public schools.,0.0
"We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.",0.0
"One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure.",0.0
"Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?",0.0
Is anybody being profiled?,0.0
Is anybody being discriminated against?,0.0
"It becomes a tool, a corrective tool.",0.0
"And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning.",0.0
"And if they are, fine.",0.0
"And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.",0.0
And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.,0.0
There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.,1.0
"Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws.",0.0
I think we still need affirmative action.,0.0
"I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor's previous position.",0.0
The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.,0.0
"But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.",0.0
"Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support.",0.0
Am I wrong about that?,0.0
"Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?",0.0
"And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment.",0.0
The death penalty.,0.0
"In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim.",0.0
The crime is hate.,0.0
And they got the ultimate punishment.,0.0
I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.,0.0
We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.,0.0
May I respond?,0.0
I don't want to jump in.,0.0
"I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee.",0.0
"There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.",0.0
"And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy.",0.0
"There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others.",0.0
And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition.,0.0
"I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.",0.0
"But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books.",0.0
That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee.,0.0
And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.,0.0
And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.,0.0
I'm not for gay marriage.,0.0
I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.,0.0
And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.,0.0
I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now.,0.0
But I think marriage is a sacred institution.,0.0
I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.,0.0
I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.,0.0
"I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view.",0.0
But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.,0.0
"I agree with that, and I did support that law.",0.0
"But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.",1.0
And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.,0.0
I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me.,0.0
"I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.",0.0
I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.,0.0
I'm not sure where he's coming from.,0.0
But I will be a tolerant person.,0.0
I've been a tolerant person all my life.,0.0
I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.,0.0
"I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.",0.0
"Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.",0.0
I strongly support it.,0.0
What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian.,0.0
And it would be a federal law preventing that.,0.0
I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.,0.0
"Well, I have no idea.",0.0
"I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law.",0.0
"I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further.",0.0
And I think that's a private matter.,0.0
And I think that's the way it ought to be.,0.0
"But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.",0.0
"That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.",0.0
"Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.",0.0
"But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.",0.0
I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.,1.0
I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to.,0.0
"The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.",0.0
I think these assault weapons are a problem.,0.0
So I favor closing the gun show loophole.,0.0
"In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.",0.0
That's still pending.,0.0
"If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.",0.0
I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.,0.0
I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.,0.0
Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.,0.0
I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.,0.0
I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.,0.0
Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country.,0.0
I think that measures like these are important.,0.0
"Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.",0.0
"Well, it starts with enforcing law.",0.0
"If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested.",0.0
"If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.",0.0
And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level.,0.0
Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.,0.0
And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.,0.0
And I'm going to make it a priority.,0.0
"Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.",0.0
That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows.,0.0
One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.,0.0
I support that.,0.0
"But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.",0.0
So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.,0.0
I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21.,0.0
I disagree with the vice president on this issue.,0.0
He is for registration of guns.,0.0
"I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.",0.0
It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.,0.0
An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.,0.0
"Well, I'm not for registration.",0.0
I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.,0.0
Correct.,0.0
The state.,0.0
"I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.",0.0
"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that.",1.0
"But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.",0.0
I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now.,0.0
"Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people.",1.0
"The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.",1.0
That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.,0.0
"Well, I'm not for photo licensing.",0.0
Let me say something about Columbine.,0.0
He says we ought to have gun-free schools.,0.0
Everybody believes that.,0.0
I'm sure every state in the union has got them.,0.0
You can't carry a gun into a school.,0.0
And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school.,0.0
But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.,0.0
It's really a matter of culture.,0.0
It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.,0.0
Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life?,0.0
"So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs.",0.0
"Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.",1.0
So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.,0.0
And we can enforce law.,0.0
But there's a larger law.,0.0
And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.,0.0
I also believe in the Golden Rule.,0.0
And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.,0.0
We do have a serious problem in our culture.,0.0
Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children.,1.0
She's worked on it longer than I have.,1.0
But I feel very strongly about that.,0.0
"And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.",0.0
But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.,0.0
"I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.",0.0
And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them.,1.0
"And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.",0.0
"Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law.",0.0
"Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.",0.0
What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.,0.0
So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.,0.0
We added beds.,0.0
We're tough.,0.0
We believe in tough love.,0.0
"We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained.",0.0
And that's what needs to happen.,0.0
We've got laws.,0.0
"If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.",0.0
"Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.",0.0
It's to make health care affordable and available this way.,0.0
"First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to.",0.0
"Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now.",0.0
"For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity.",0.0
"In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do.",0.0
"One, we need more community health centers.",0.0
I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.,0.0
These are places where people can get primary care.,0.0
Secondly -- and they're good.,0.0
"Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.",0.0
I think that's the very best way to go.,0.0
"It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.",0.0
"It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.",0.0
"I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system.",0.0
"In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government.",0.0
I want a smaller and smarter government.,0.0
"I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.",0.0
"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.",1.0
So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.,0.0
But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.,0.0
I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.,0.0
So it's one of my top priorities.,0.0
"Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.",0.0
"49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.",0.0
So it is a priority for me.,0.0
I guarantee you.,0.0
"I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.",0.0
I think it ought to be a top priority.,0.0
"First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system?",1.0
"Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.",0.0
"Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.",0.0
"Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President.",0.0
But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union.,0.0
"And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999.",0.0
"We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program.",0.0
"You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas.",0.0
"We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.",0.0
"Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.",0.0
"And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.",0.0
"And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.",0.0
"He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.",0.0
I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.,0.0
"If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong.",0.0
And they get health care.,0.0
"But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased.",0.0
Let me just tell you who the jury is.,1.0
The people of Texas.,1.0
"There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.",0.0
"And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person.",1.0
So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.,0.0
I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.,0.0
We come together both Republicans and Democrats.,0.0
"Yes, yes.",0.0
But it's not a statement about his heart.,0.0
I don't claim to know his heart.,0.0
I think he's a good person.,0.0
I make no allegations about that.,0.0
I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.,0.0
I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person.,0.0
But I think it's about his priorities.,0.0
"And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?",0.0
I would.,0.0
"Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.",0.0
According to his own numbers.,0.0
"So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.",0.0
It's a question of priorities and values.,0.0
That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.,0.0
The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.,0.0
The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.,0.0
"And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.",0.0
"That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.",0.0
We just have a different point of view.,0.0
It's a totally different point of view.,0.0
He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.,0.0
I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.,0.0
"Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute.",0.0
We pay 4.7 billion.,0.0
I can't emphasize to you how much.,0.0
I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.,0.0
The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session.,0.0
We're working hard to sign up children.,0.0
"We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.",0.0
We're making really good progress.,0.0
And our state cares a lot about our children.,0.0
My priority is going to be the health of our citizens.,0.0
They have not done it.,0.0
They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.,0.0
And they have not got it done.,0.0
"And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.",1.0
"But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.",0.0
I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming.,0.0
There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.,0.0
Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes.,0.0
And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly.,0.0
"Now, here is the good news, Jim.",0.0
"If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies.",0.0
You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.,1.0
They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.,0.0
"Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living.",0.0
And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time.,0.0
I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated.,0.0
We have to be bold.,0.0
We have to provide leadership.,0.0
Now it's true that we disagree on this.,0.0
The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people.,0.0
He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.,0.0
And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.,0.0
We have a very different outlook.,0.0
"And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.",0.0
"Well, let me start with Texas.",0.0
We are a big industrial state.,0.0
We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.,0.0
"We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my state's history, 450 of them.",0.0
Our water is cleaner now.,0.0
A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers.,0.0
And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.,0.0
"I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.",0.0
"The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.",0.0
"And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.",0.0
I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.,0.0
I think we need to have clean coal technologies.,0.0
I propose $2 billion worth.,0.0
"By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area.",0.0
And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there.,0.0
We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down.,0.0
"Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas.",0.0
No excuses.,0.0
You must conform.,0.0
"In other words, there are practical things we can do.",0.0
"If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.",0.0
People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.,0.0
"I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming.",0.0
He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.,0.0
I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies.,0.0
"And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that.",0.0
"We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said.",0.0
We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary.,0.0
I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.,0.0
We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.,0.0
I think it's a fundamental difference.,0.0
Let me give you an example.,0.0
"And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it.",0.0
That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.,0.0
I think there's a difference.,0.0
"Out in the west, yeah.",0.0
That's not the way I would have done it.,0.0
Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside.,0.0
But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.,0.0
So long as people have input.,0.0
I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.,0.0
But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet.,0.0
And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions.,0.0
I tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air.,0.0
Like Kyoto Treaty would have done.,0.0
China and India were exempted from that treaty.,0.0
"I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.",0.0
"Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded.",0.0
But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate.,0.0
I'm not for command and control techniques either.,0.0
"I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with.",0.0
But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming.,0.0
I think that we do.,0.0
"It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.",0.0
"Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable.",0.0
What are we going to tell our children?,0.0
I'm a grandfather now.,0.0
I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm.,0.0
"In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, ""Where your heart is, there is your treasure also.""",1.0
And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.,0.0
"Yeah, I agree.",0.0
"I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming?",0.0
I've been trying so hard not to.,0.0
Twice.,0.0
"I apologize, Mr. Vice President.",0.0
Of course they care about them.,0.0
"Oh, you mean the rules.",0.0
What the heck.,0.0
"I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.",0.0
"And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment.",0.0
We may have different approaches.,0.0
We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.,0.0
I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.,0.0
"And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place.",0.0
I feel very strongly the same place.,0.0
"It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.",0.0
"Well, we all make mistakes.",0.0
"I've been known to mangle a syl-a-ble or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean.",0.0
I think credibility is important.,0.0
"It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations.",0.0
"And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.",0.0
This isn't something new.,0.0
"I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims.",1.0
I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen.,1.0
"The Earned Income Tax Credit, sorry.",0.0
"A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it?",0.0
"Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't.",0.0
And so I think this is an issue.,0.0
I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.,0.0
I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.,0.0
"Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.",0.0
"That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case.",0.0
And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.,0.0
That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.,0.0
"I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that.",0.0
And I'm going to try to do better.,0.0
One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make.,0.0
"However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that.",0.0
"There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.",0.0
More sometimes than people in foreign countries.,0.0
And we need to do something about that.,0.0
Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.,0.0
And that means doing it under the Medicare program.,0.0
I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong.,0.0
"I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard.",0.0
"But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.",1.0
"That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?",0.0
Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.,0.0
I hope they're not awful things.,0.0
I think they may be using the man's own words.,0.0
Maybe they have.,0.0
Wait a minute.,0.0
I understand.,0.0
"The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?",0.0
You haven't seen the commercial?,0.0
I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.,0.0
That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about.,0.0
I'm glad you clarified that.,0.0
"Mr. Hankins, I don't feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patient's bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses.",0.0
"I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.",0.0
"Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.",0.0
And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy.,1.0
He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.,1.0
This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership.,0.0
One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong.,0.0
"And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured.",0.0
"Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.",0.0
"Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies.",0.0
That is unacceptable.,0.0
I support a strong national patient's bill of rights.,0.0
"It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.",0.0
"I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.",0.0
It's a tragic moment.,0.0
"Actually, Mr. Vice President, it's not true.",0.0
I do support a national patient's bill of rights.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.",0.0
"It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.",0.0
"You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that's what we did in my state.",0.0
We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.,0.0
"It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist.",0.0
"It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.",0.0
"The HMO, the insurance company, can't gag that doctor from giving you full advice.",0.0
"And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to.",0.0
But we did something else that was interesting.,0.0
We're one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage.,0.0
Now there's what's called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first.,0.0
"It says if youâ€™ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body.",0.0
"If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules.",0.0
"However, if the insurance company doesn't follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law.",0.0
"It's time for our nation to come together and do what's right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.",0.0
"You know, I support a national patient's bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered.",0.0
I don't want the law to supersede good law like we've got in Texas.,0.0
"Jim, we have a direct disagreement on this.",0.0
Absolutely not.,0.0
I referred to the Dingle-Norwood bill.,0.0
It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress.,0.0
"The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward.",0.0
"They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support.",0.0
It is being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress.,0.0
"Well, the difference is is that I can get it done.",0.0
That I can get something positive done on behalf of the people.,0.0
That's what the question in this campaign is about.,0.0
"It's not only what's your philosophy and what's your position on issues, but can you get things done?",0.0
And I believe I can.,0.0
What about the Dingle-Norwood bill?,0.0
I'm not quite through.,0.0
Let me finish.,0.0
I talked about the principles and the issues that I think are important in a patient's bill of rights.,0.0
"Well, it's in this committee or it's got this sponsor.",0.0
"If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.",0.0
People will be able to take their HMO insurance company to court.,0.0
That's what I've done in Texas and that's the kind of leadership style I'll bring to Washington.,0.0
"Well, that's a great question.",0.0
"I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare.",0.0
"And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, there's no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors.",0.0
"So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.",0.0
"So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.",0.0
"In the meantime, I think it's important to have what's called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don't have to choose between food and medicine.",0.0
That's part of an overall overhaul.,0.0
And I'm against price controls.,0.0
I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.,0.0
Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it.,0.0
One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.,0.0
And so I'm against price controls.,0.0
"Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.",0.0
"Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States.",0.0
That makes sense.,0.0
But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.,0.0
"All right, here we go again.",0.0
"Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.",0.0
"If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you.",0.0
And you asked a great question because it's not only seniors.,0.0
"Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.",0.0
They do some great things.,0.0
They discover great new cures and that's great.,0.0
We want them to continue that.,0.0
But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion.,0.0
You see all these ads?,0.0
Than they are on research and development.,0.0
And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.,0.0
I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.,0.0
"Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.",0.0
The governor talked about Medicare.,0.0
"I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here's how it works.",0.0
"You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you.",0.0
The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.,0.0
You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price.,0.0
"If you're poor, they pay all of it.",0.0
"If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket.",0.0
And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.,0.0
"And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen.",1.0
"Well, you know, it's hard to make people love one another.",0.0
I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it.,0.0
I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents.,0.0
"One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.",1.0
"I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.",0.0
"I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child's school isn't doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education.",0.0
I recognize there are some who just don't seem to care.,0.0
"But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met.",0.0
That's why I'm so strong for accountability.,0.0
"I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.",0.0
We do so in my state of Texas.,0.0
One of the good things we've gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can't cure unless you know.,0.0
You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.,0.0
I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure.,0.0
"That's why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can't be sued.",0.0
They can't be sued.,0.0
I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.,0.0
"I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence.",0.0
"Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.",0.0
We can't continue to shuffle children through school.,0.0
And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.,0.0
We have huge difference between us on this question.,0.0
I'd like to start by telling you what my vision is.,0.0
"I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.",0.0
"Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student.",0.0
Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools.,0.0
"It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years.",0.0
"It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.",0.0
"We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills.",0.0
"I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college.",0.0
"I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else.",0.0
"Now, I said there was a contrast.",0.0
"Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.",0.0
"And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.",0.0
I think that's a mistake.,0.0
I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools.,0.0
"I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.",0.0
"Yeah, I appreciate that.",0.0
"I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond.",0.0
Here's what I think.,0.0
"First of all, vouchers are up to states.",0.0
"If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine.",0.0
I strongly believe in local control of schools.,0.0
I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.,0.0
I believe in local control of schools.,0.0
"I've said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning.",0.0
What's unreasonable about that?,0.0
We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement.,0.0
And if we find success we'll praise it.,0.0
"But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.",0.0
"And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school.",0.0
"You see, there has to be a consequence.",0.0
"We've got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through.",0.0
And guess who suffers.,0.0
"Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.",0.0
"Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up.",0.0
"Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.",1.0
"Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they're doing.",0.0
"It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.",0.0
"If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently.",0.0
But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools.,0.0
"We have to turn around -- most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are.",0.0
What grade do you teach?,0.0
High school.,0.0
I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.,0.0
"Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.",0.0
"It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.",1.0
More than 90% of America's children go to public schools.,0.0
And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.,0.0
We've got to do something about this.,0.0
And local -- it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts.,0.0
They're not able to do it and our future depends upon it.,0.0
"Look, we're in an information age.",0.0
Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college.,0.0
"And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.",0.0
"My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where they're most needed.",0.0
"Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability.",0.0
My plan requires testing of all students.,0.0
It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.,0.0
"It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.",0.0
"We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.",0.0
"When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years.",0.0
And there's just not going to be enough money.,0.0
"I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority.",0.0
That's what governors ought to do.,0.0
They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state.,0.0
The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.,0.0
"I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.",0.0
What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money.,0.0
One size does not fit all.,0.0
I worry about federalizing education if I were you.,0.0
"I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.",0.0
We need to have accountability.,0.0
"The Vice President's plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade.",0.0
We need to demand on results.,0.0
I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned.,0.0
"I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom.",0.0
Part of it's because you can't -- you can't control the classroom.,0.0
You can't have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law.,0.0
So I'm going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act.,0.0
"So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.",0.0
There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.,0.0
"The federal government can be a part, but don't fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level.",0.0
94% comes from the local level.,0.0
I'm so glad that I have the chance to knock that down.,0.0
"Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.",0.0
Now under my plan we'll balance the budget every year.,0.0
I'm not just saying this.,0.0
I'm not just talking.,0.0
"I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt.",0.0
"And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years.",0.0
"One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt?",0.0
We get nothing for it.,0.0
We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.,0.0
I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade.,0.0
That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy.,0.0
"Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else.",1.0
"Well, he's wrong.",0.0
It's three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed.,0.0
"That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.",1.0
My turn?,0.0
"Yes, sir.",0.0
Forget the journalists.,0.0
He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined.,0.0
This is a big spender.,0.0
"And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.",0.0
We just have a different philosophy.,0.0
Let me talk about tax relief.,0.0
"If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.",0.0
The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.,0.0
I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.,0.0
"I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it.",0.0
"And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.",0.0
But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits.,0.0
And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.,0.0
"If you're a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes.",0.0
What I've done is set priorities and funded them.,0.0
And there's extra money.,0.0
And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back.,0.0
It's a difference of opinion.,0.0
He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.,0.0
I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.,0.0
Of course it does.,0.0
"If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.",0.0
People who pay taxes will get tax relief.,0.0
Afterwards they pay 64%.,0.0
This is a fair plan.,0.0
You know why?,0.0
Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.,0.0
"If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year today and you're trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000, and that's not right.",0.0
So I want to do something about that.,0.0
"Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.",0.0
It is about you.,0.0
And I want to come back to something I said before.,0.0
"If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.",0.0
"If you want somebody who will fight for you and who will fight to have middle-class tax cuts, then I am your man.",0.0
I want to be.,0.0
"Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.",0.0
"I won't ask you, but if you do, you're in the top 1%.",0.0
"But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.",0.0
Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.,1.0
Good.,0.0
50 million Americans get no tax relief under his plan.,0.0
That's not right.,0.0
"You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.",0.0
"And secondly, we've had enough fighting.",0.0
It's time to unite.,0.0
You talk about eight years?,0.0
"In eight years they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patient's bill of rights.",0.0
It's time to get something done.,0.0
"Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim.",0.0
Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.,0.0
"It was due to go bankrupt in 1999 and that 50 million figure again, the newspapers -- I said -- you said forget the journalists, but they are the keepers of the score card and whether or not you're using facts that aren't right.",0.0
And that fact is just not right.,0.0
I've been a leader.,0.0
I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow.,0.0
I've got a strategy for the Middle East.,0.0
"And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions.",0.0
Our nation needs to be credible and strong.,0.0
"When we say we're somebody's friend, everybody has got to believe it.",0.0
Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.,0.0
We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace.,0.0
We can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable.,0.0
It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.,0.0
"We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.",0.0
You can't worry about polls or focus groups.,0.0
You've got to have a clear vision.,0.0
That's what a leader does.,0.0
A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.,0.0
Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.,0.0
Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling.,0.0
Sanctions are loosened.,0.0
"The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we don't know because inspectors aren't in.",0.0
"So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.",0.0
"I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.",0.0
Even in Iran they have had an election that began to bring about some change.,0.0
We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.,0.0
Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.,1.0
I will -- I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way.,0.0
"Now, what can I bring to that challenge?",0.0
"When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War.",0.0
"When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.",0.0
"I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam.",0.0
"I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.",0.0
"In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.",0.0
"Look, we're gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years.",0.0
I've worked on that long and hard.,0.0
"When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee.",0.0
"And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry.",0.0
"In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.",0.0
And for the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council.,0.0
Can I say just one other thing here?,0.0
"Fine, I'll wait.",0.0
"I think he gets a -- oh, I'm sorry, you're right, go ahead.",0.0
"Thank you, sir.",0.0
"Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.",0.0
It's a difficult situation.,0.0
The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability.,0.0
And that means keeping our military strong.,0.0
"Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that's coming in this strong economy from the private sector.",0.0
"And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.",0.0
I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry.,0.0
The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology.,0.0
"I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.",0.0
"You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.",0.0
"Now, readiness.",0.0
"The trends before we -- before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced.",0.0
I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up.,0.0
And I'm happy to tell you that we have.,0.0
"Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose.",0.0
The governor proposes $45 billion.,0.0
I propose more than twice as much because I think it's needed.,0.0
"If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.",0.0
I readily admit I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is.,0.0
Your question was deployment.,0.0
"It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.",0.0
The mission must be clear.,0.0
Soldiers must understand why we're going.,0.0
The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished.,0.0
And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined.,0.0
I'm concerned that we're overdeployed around the world.,0.0
"See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy.",1.0
"Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.",0.0
And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.,0.0
"There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often.",0.0
The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military.,0.0
"I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.",0.0
"But we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal.",0.0
"We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we're smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace.",0.0
"This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace.",0.0
Spending money is one thing.,0.0
But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.,0.0
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.",0.0
I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad.,0.0
"But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.",0.0
I'm sorry.,0.0
"Well, I don't think I ran the ad.",0.0
I think somebody who doesn't want me to be president might have run that ad.,0.0
That wasn't my ad.,0.0
I think it might have been one of my opponent's ads.,0.0
"Here is what I believe, sir.",0.0
I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families.,0.0
I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them.,0.0
"That's why I'm for instant background checks at gun shows, I'm for trigger locks, I think that makes sense.",0.0
"Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe.",0.0
I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.,0.0
But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.,0.0
"If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence.",0.0
"If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.",0.0
"Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help.",0.0
"There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.",0.0
To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.,0.0
"And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't.",0.0
I'm a pretty independent thinker.,0.0
And I'm for enforcing laws on the books.,0.0
"Well, it was not one of my ads, either, Governor.",0.0
"But I am familiar with the statement, and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization.",0.0
Let me tell you my position.,0.0
I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people.,0.0
"But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety.",0.0
"None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.",0.0
"Let's make our schools safe, let's make our neighborhoods safe.",0.0
"Let's have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldn't have guns don't get them.",0.0
"But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago.",0.0
Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government.,0.0
"Governor, I'm not.",0.0
And let me tell you what the record shows.,0.0
For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government.,0.0
"And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means.",0.0
"The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people.",0.0
And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration.,1.0
"During the last five years, Texas's government has gone up in size.",0.0
"Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.",0.0
"Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.",0.0
We can do that.,0.0
We've got a bumper crop this year.,0.0
But that's the good news.,0.0
You know what the bad news is that follows on that.,0.0
The prices are low.,0.0
"In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure.",1.0
I want to change many of its provisions.,0.0
Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn't eat except for them.,0.0
"And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you.",1.0
I want to change those provisions.,0.0
I want to restore a meaningful safety net.,0.0
"And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you're specifically including conservation and protection of the environment.",0.0
"And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists.",0.0
"And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment.",0.0
I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program.,0.0
"And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them -- enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest.",0.0
"Now, I'll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs.",0.0
I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.,0.0
"So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net.",0.0
I would like our farmers feeding the world.,0.0
"We're the best producers in the world, and I want -- I want the farmers feeding the world.",0.0
We need to open up markets.,0.0
"Exports are down, and every time an export number goes down, it hurts the farmer.",0.0
I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.,0.0
I don't want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward.,0.0
We shouldn't be using food.,0.0
It hurts the farmers.,0.0
It's not the right thing to do.,0.0
I'm for value-added processing.,0.0
We need more work on value-added processing.,0.0
"You take the raw product you produce, I presume you're a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it.",0.0
Value-added processing is important.,0.0
I'm for research and development.,0.0
Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products.,0.0
"I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax.",1.0
One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax.,0.0
This is a bad tax.,1.0
The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.,0.0
It's a tax that taxes people twice.,0.0
It penalizes the family farmer.,0.0
"So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand -- I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security.",0.0
I'm from a big farm state.,0.0
We're the second biggest state -- farming state in the country.,0.0
And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.,0.0
Every day is earth day if you own the land.,0.0
I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.,0.0
Thank you.,0.0
I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.,0.0
"And under the plan that I've proposed, 80% of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax.",0.0
"And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt, and all of the others would have sharply reduced.",1.0
So 80% -- now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%.,0.0
"The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle-class families.",0.0
"And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.",0.0
Eliminating the death tax.,0.0
Because people shouldn't be taxed twice on their assets.,0.0
It's either unfair for some or unfair for all.,0.0
"Again, this is just a difference of opinion.",0.0
"If you're from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners.",0.0
I don't think that's the role of the president.,0.0
"I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.",0.0
"Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.",0.0
It is -- I'm not so sure 80% of the people get the death tax.,0.0
"I know this, 100% will get it if I'm the president.",0.0
I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.,0.0
It's a fairness issue.,0.0
"It's an issue of principle, not politics.",0.0
Appreciate that question.,0.0
"Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.",0.0
Government ought to stand on the side of parents.,1.0
"Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture.",0.0
You bet there's things that government can do.,0.0
We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour.,0.0
We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.,0.0
"There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in.",0.0
I think we ought to have character education in our schools.,0.0
"I know that doesn't directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you're teaching.",0.0
"Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time.",0.0
There's afterschool money available.,0.0
I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.,0.0
That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well.,0.0
"Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we're free.",1.0
And so I don't support censorship.,0.0
But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.,0.0
I think we need to have rating systems that are clear.,0.0
"I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.",0.0
"I'll remind mothers and dads the best weapon is the off/on button, and paying attention to your children, and eating dinner with them and being -- I'm sorry.",0.0
My turn.,0.0
I care a lot about this.,0.0
"It's not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet.",0.0
Parents now feel like you have to compete with the mass culture in order to raise your kids with the values that you want them to have.,0.0
Tipper and I have four children.,0.0
"And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.",0.0
I don't want to embarrass our oldest daughter.,0.0
"She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.",0.0
And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents.,0.0
And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.,0.0
I've been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents' protection page every time 95% of the pages come up.,0.0
And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately.,0.0
"You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.",0.0
"But if you can check up on them, that's real power.",0.0
"And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.",0.0
That is an outrage.,0.0
Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act.,0.0
"And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.",0.0
"I'll tell you this, I want to do something about this.",0.0
"Respect the First Amendment, but I will do something to help you raise your kids without that garbage.",0.0
Right next to the last.,0.0
We've got to change it.,0.0
"I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.",0.0
And I want to tell you what I tell them.,0.0
"Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arm's length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they're gonna be let down and disappointed.",0.0
But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union.,1.0
"We're America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future.",1.0
"Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.",0.0
And that is the current campaign financing system.,0.0
And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.,0.0
I don't believe that's a fair measure.,0.0
"I'm telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president.",0.0
Governor Bush opposes it.,0.0
I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that.,0.0
"Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.",0.0
Let me tell you why.,0.0
"Those issues you mentioned, Social Security, prescription drugs, the big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that I've made.",0.0
Bush does not support.,0.0
The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel.,0.0
"They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.",0.0
We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.,0.0
And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be.,1.0
We can.,1.0
Tell you what I hear.,0.0
They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.,0.0
"There's a lot of young folks saying, you know, why do I want to be involved with this mess?",0.0
"And what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense.",0.0
"Medicare, I know you talked about it, but Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike.",0.0
We better get it right now.,0.0
Tax reform is relevant for old and young alike.,0.0
I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off.,0.0
I think it's the tone.,0.0
I think it's the attitude.,0.0
I think it's a cynicism in Washington and it doesn't have to be that way.,1.0
"Before I decided to run, I had to resolve two issues in my mind.",0.0
"One, could our family endure all this business.",0.0
And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.,0.0
That's what happened in Texas.,0.0
We worked together.,0.0
There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.,0.0
He is the chairman of the health committee.,0.0
"He came here for a reason, to tout our record on health in Texas.",0.0
He's a Democrat.,0.0
I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.,0.0
What I cared about is could we work together.,0.0
"And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.",0.0
That's the best way to get people back in the system.,0.0
"Hi, Norma.",0.0
"I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.",0.0
I'm going to find people that want to serve their country.,0.0
"But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.",0.0
"I've worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy.",1.0
Policy that rejects quotas.,0.0
I don't like quotas.,0.0
Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.,0.0
Quotas are bad for America.,0.0
It's not the way America is all about.,0.0
But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.,0.0
"For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.",0.0
"And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.",0.0
"What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access.",0.0
I think the contracting business in government can help.,0.0
"Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example.",0.0
"The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.",0.0
"I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.",0.0
"So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.",0.0
I'll have an administration that will make you proud.,0.0
I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart.,0.0
"I believe that our future as a nation depends upon whether or not we can break down these barriers that have been used to pit group against group, and bring our people together.",0.0
How do you do it?,0.0
"Well, you establish respect for differences.",0.0
You don't ignore differences.,0.0
"It's all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we're just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you've had, that others have had.",0.0
"Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit.",0.0
I don't know what affirmative access means.,0.0
I do know what affirmative action means.,0.0
"I know the governor is against it, and I know that I'm for it.",0.0
I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death.,1.0
"I'm for that proposed law, the governor is against it.",0.0
I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.,0.0
I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity.,0.0
"And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.",0.0
Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.,0.0
And I want to honor that among his other achievements here.,1.0
"Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws.",0.0
I'm against quotas.,1.0
"This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.",1.0
Affirmative action isn't quotas.,0.0
"I'm against quotas, they're illegal.",0.0
They're against the American way.,0.0
"Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.",0.0
"If affirmative action means quotas, I'm against it.",0.0
"If affirmative action means what I just described what I'm for, then I'm for it.",0.0
You heard what I was for.,0.0
The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.,0.0
"You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.",0.0
"He said if affirmative action means quotas, he's against it.",0.0
Affirmative action doesn't mean quotas.,0.0
Are you for it without quotas?,0.0
"I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.",0.0
Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?,0.0
"No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules don't mean anything.",0.0
"No, I'm not proud of that.",0.0
"The death penalty is a very serious business, Leo.",0.0
It's an issue that good people obviously disagree on.,0.0
I take my job seriously.,0.0
"And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do.",0.0
I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.,0.0
During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty.,0.0
I said I did if administered fairly and justly.,0.0
"Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.",0.0
"If it's administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives.",0.0
"One of the things that happens when you're a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions.",0.0
"You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.",0.0
"And that's what I did, sir.",0.0
There have been some tough cases come across my desk.,0.0
Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.,0.0
"But my job is to ask two questions, sir.",0.0
Is the person guilty of the crime?,0.0
And did the person have full access to the courts of law?,0.0
"And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative.",0.0
I'm not proud of any record.,0.0
I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas.,0.0
I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.,0.0
"But I'm not proud of any record, sir, I'm not.",0.0
I support the death penalty.,0.0
"I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.",0.0
"If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody is waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy?",0.0
"If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.",0.0
"Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.",0.0
And in some cases may be still at large.,0.0
But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.,1.0
I do.,0.0
It's the only reason to be for it.,0.0
I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.,0.0
I don't think that's right.,0.0
I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.,0.0
I think it is a deterrent.,0.0
"I know that's a controversial view, but I do believe it's a deterrent.",0.0
(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.,0.0
"And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.",0.0
I think the record shows otherwise.,0.0
We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.,1.0
"Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured.",0.0
"22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.",0.0
"Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.",0.0
Here are some promises that I'll make to you now.,0.0
I will balance the budget every year.,0.0
I will pay down the debt every year.,0.0
"I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones.",0.0
"And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security.",0.0
We both made promises in this campaign.,0.0
I promise you I will keep mine.,0.0
Let me tell you about one of the governor's.,0.0
He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own.,0.0
"But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.",0.0
So this is a show me state.,0.0
"Reminds me of the line from the movie, ""Show me the money.""",0.0
"Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?",0.0
Thank you for your question.,0.0
"(LAUGHTER) I -- there's an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end.",0.0
You asked about promises.,0.0
"You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.",0.0
You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992.,0.0
It didn't happen.,0.0
There's too much bitterness in Washington.,1.0
There's too much wrangling.,1.0
It's time to have a fresh start.,0.0
One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn't try to be all things to all people.,0.0
"When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didn't think I could win including, by the way, my mother.",0.0
"(LAUGHTER) I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform.",0.0
And I won.,0.0
And I had the will of the people in my state behind me.,1.0
And then I brought folks together to get it done.,0.0
"And that's what we need, I think, in this election.",0.0
To me that's what it's all about.,0.0
"But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.",0.0
"One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.",0.0
"Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.",0.0
People are going to get paid.,0.0
"But if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits.",1.0
That's one of my promises.,0.0
That's what it requires.,0.0
There was a chance to get this done.,0.0
"It was a bipartisan approach, but it's been rejected.",0.0
I'm going to bring them together.,0.0
"Well, first of all, Jim, I would like to respond to what the governor just said.",0.0
Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people.,0.0
And you cannot keep both promises.,0.0
"If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund.",0.0
Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.,0.0
Now that is the difference.,0.0
"And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this.",0.0
"This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future.",0.0
The reason Social Security -- he says it gets 2%.,0.0
"You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.",0.0
It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on.,0.0
"If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?",0.0
Now let me come directly to your question.,0.0
One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.,0.0
The trillion dollars comes out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money.,0.0
There's just a difference of opinion.,0.0
I want workers to have their own assets.,0.0
"It's who you trust, government or people.",0.0
"Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions -- your last question.",0.0
I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today because we have seen a time of great challenge for our country.,0.0
I would like to tell you something about me.,0.0
I keep my word.,0.0
I have kept the faith.,0.0
I've kept the faith with my country.,0.0
I volunteered for the Army.,0.0
I served in Vietnam.,0.0
I kept the faith with my family.,0.0
Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.,0.0
We have devoted ourselves to our children and now our nearly one-and-a-half-year-old grandson.,0.0
I have kept the faith with our country.,0.0
"Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution, and I have never violated that oath.",0.0
I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.,0.0
I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America.,0.0
I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.,0.0
"If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it.",1.0
We've made some progress during the last eight years.,0.0
We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States.,0.0
Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.,0.0
"Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.",0.0
You ain't seen nothing yet.,0.0
And I will keep that promise.,0.0
"Well, Jim, I want to thank you and thank the folks here at Washington University and the vice president.",0.0
"Appreciate the chance to have a good, honest dialogue about our differences of opinion.",0.0
I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country.,0.0
It's an agenda that says we're going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose.,0.0
"It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.",0.0
A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president.,0.0
"After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.",0.0
I don't think the surplus is the government's money.,0.0
I think it's the people's money.,0.0
"I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.",0.0
And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build.,0.0
I look forward to the final weeks of this campaign.,0.0
I'm asking for your vote.,0.0
"For those of you for me, thanks for your help.",0.0
"For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once.",0.0
"(LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise.",0.0
"Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.",0.0
Thank you very much.,0.0
"Yes, I do.",0.0
"But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.",0.0
I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us.,0.0
And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate.,0.0
You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine.,0.0
Our hearts go out to you.,0.0
And we admire your pluck and perseverance.,0.0
I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.,0.0
And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.,0.0
But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.,0.0
I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.,0.0
I'll never give a veto to any country over our security.,0.0
But I also know how to lead those alliances.,0.0
"This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we're now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs.",0.0
"I think that's wrong, and I think we can do better.",0.0
I have a better plan for homeland security.,0.0
"I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America.",0.0
I know I can do a better job in Iraq.,0.0
"I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.",0.0
"We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.",0.0
"All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.",0.0
"I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.",0.0
September the 11th changed how America must look at the world.,0.0
"And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.",0.0
We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.,0.0
The rest of them know we're after them.,0.0
"We've upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorist.",0.0
Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.,0.0
"In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize.",0.0
Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell.,0.0
America and the world are safer for it.,0.0
We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.,0.0
Libya has disarmed.,0.0
"And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.",0.0
Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.,0.0
Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.,0.0
"No, I don't believe it's going to happen.",0.0
"I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.",1.0
I've shown the American people I know how to lead.,0.0
I have -- I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made.,0.0
And I made some tough decisions.,0.0
But people know where I stand.,1.0
People out there listening know what I believe.,1.0
And that's how best it is to keep the peace.,0.0
This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.,0.0
And that's what they are.,0.0
"This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, that'll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will.",1.0
We have a duty to defeat this enemy.,0.0
We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.,0.0
"The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty.",0.0
And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.,0.0
Ten million citizens have registered to vote.,0.0
It's a phenomenal statistic.,0.0
"In Iraq, no doubt about it, it's tough.",0.0
It's hard work.,0.0
It's incredibly hard.,0.0
You know why?,0.0
Because an enemy realizes the stakes.,0.0
The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.,0.0
That's why they're fighting so vociferously.,0.0
"They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn't.",0.0
And they're showing up in Iraq for the same reason.,0.0
They're trying to defeat us.,0.0
"And if we lose our will, we lose.",0.0
"But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.",0.0
I believe in being strong and resolute and determined.,0.0
"And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.",0.0
"But we also have to be smart, Jim.",0.0
"And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein.",0.0
"This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment.",1.0
And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.,0.0
"I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.",1.0
And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.,0.0
"Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora.",0.0
We had him surrounded.,0.0
"But we didn't use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him.",0.0
The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too.,0.0
That's wrong.,0.0
"Well, where do you want me to begin?",0.0
"First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.",1.0
"In fact, he first didn't even want to do that.",1.0
"And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U. N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.",0.0
"Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.",0.0
We had Saddam Hussein trapped.,0.0
He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort.,0.0
"Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.",0.0
"""Last resort.""",0.0
"You've got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, ""I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter.""",0.0
I don't believe the United States did that.,0.0
And we pushed our allies aside.,0.0
"And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.",0.0
And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror.,0.0
"The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world's opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times.",0.0
"The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.",0.0
"Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden -- than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden?",0.0
I don't think so.,0.0
My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.,0.0
He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president.,0.0
I agree with him.,0.0
The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.,0.0
I was hoping diplomacy would work.,0.0
I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm's way.,0.0
It's the hardest decision a president makes.,0.0
So I went to the United Nations.,0.0
I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.,0.0
I decided to go there myself.,0.0
"And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.",0.0
"They passed the resolution that said, ""Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences.""",0.0
"I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says.",0.0
Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming.,0.0
Why should he?,0.0
He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.",0.0
The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.,0.0
That wasn't going to work.,0.0
"That's kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place.",0.0
He was hoping we'd turn away.,0.0
But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action.,0.0
We did.,0.0
The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.,0.0
"Jim, we've got the capability of doing both.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.",0.0
"We're facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they'll strike anywhere, with any means.",0.0
"And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.",0.0
"That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.",0.0
But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.,0.0
Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.,0.0
He's isolated.,0.0
"The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.",0.0
We're making progress.,0.0
But the front on this war is more than just one place.,0.0
"And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror.",0.0
That's why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us.,0.0
Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.,0.0
The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.,0.0
We will succeed.,0.0
We've got a plan to do so.,0.0
And the main reason we'll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free.,0.0
I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi.,0.0
"He's a strong, courageous leader.",0.0
He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.,0.0
"He doesn't want U. S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.",0.0
"He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.",0.0
They just need the help to be trained.,0.0
There will be elections in January.,0.0
We're spending reconstruction money.,0.0
And our alliance is strong.,0.0
That's the plan for victory.,0.0
"And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.",0.0
The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror.,1.0
Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.,1.0
The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq.,0.0
And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace.,0.0
"Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make.",0.0
You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.,0.0
You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need.,0.0
"I've met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they're going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids.",1.0
Some of them got it for a birthday present.,1.0
I think that's wrong.,0.0
"Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.",0.0
And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.,1.0
But it's getting worse by the day.,0.0
More soldiers killed in June than before.,0.0
More in July than June.,0.0
More in August than July.,0.0
More in September than in August.,0.0
And now we see beheadings.,0.0
"And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they're blowing people up.",0.0
And we don't have enough troops there.,0.0
"Thank you, sir.",0.0
"First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.",1.0
"I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place.",0.0
What message does that send our troops?,0.0
What message does that send to our allies?,0.0
What message does that send the Iraqis?,0.0
"No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.",0.0
"Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.",0.0
"And I will succeed for those troops, now that we're there.",0.0
We have to succeed.,0.0
We can't leave a failed Iraq.,0.0
But that doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden.,0.0
It was.,0.0
"Now, we can succeed.",0.0
But I don't believe this president can.,0.0
I think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what's necessary to make it so America isn't doing this alone.,0.0
"Jim, let me tell you exactly what I'll do.",0.0
And there are a long list of thing.,0.0
"First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America?",0.0
"What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we're shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America.",0.0
"The president hasn't put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems.",0.0
That's why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there.,0.0
We hadn't done the work that ought to be done.,0.0
"The president -- 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected.",0.0
"Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed.",0.0
Does that make you feel safer in America?,0.0
This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security.,0.0
Those aren't my values.,0.0
I believe in protecting America first.,0.0
"And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that's who gets it -- long before we do, I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.",0.0
"The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn't want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure.",0.0
And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.,0.0
"That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.",0.0
"Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union -- former Soviet Union for 13 years.",0.0
I'm going to do it in four years.,0.0
And we're going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.,0.0
I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.,0.0
It's like a huge tax gap.,0.0
"Anyway, that's for another debate.",0.0
My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.,0.0
My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.,0.0
"We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.",0.0
We're modernizing our borders.,0.0
"We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion.",0.0
We're doing our duty to provide the funding.,0.0
But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.,0.0
"You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time.",0.0
And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.,0.0
There's a lot of good people working hard.,0.0
"And by the way, we've also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority.",0.0
We're communicating better.,0.0
We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.,0.0
The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.,0.0
"But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.",0.0
The president just said the FBI had changed its culture.,0.0
"We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.",0.0
On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time.,0.0
And the test is not whether you're spending more money.,0.0
"The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe?",0.0
We didn't need that tax cut.,0.0
America needed to be safe.,0.0
Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.,0.0
I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America.,0.0
That's my job.,0.0
"I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us.",0.0
There's a lot of really good people working hard to do so.,0.0
"But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again.",0.0
Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job.,0.0
"We've got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year.",0.0
That is the best way.,0.0
We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.,0.0
I believe they want to.,0.0
Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.,1.0
"And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.",0.0
"And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.",0.0
And I hope it's as soon as possible.,0.0
But I know putting artificial deadlines won't work.,0.0
"My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months.""",0.0
You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror.,0.0
"My message to our troops is, ""Thank you for what you're doing.",1.0
We're standing with you strong.,1.0
We'll give you all the equipment you need.,1.0
"And we'll get you home as soon as the mission's done, because this is a vital mission.""",1.0
"A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that's essential.",0.0
A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom.,0.0
A free Iraq will help secure Israel.,0.0
A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.,0.0
A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.,0.0
"Thank you, Jim.",0.0
"My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they're doing, but it's also help is on the way.",0.0
I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today.,0.0
"You know, it's interesting.",0.0
"When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.",1.0
And they both looked at me and said: We need you.,1.0
You've got to help us over there.,1.0
Now I believe there's a better way to do this.,0.0
"You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.",0.0
"And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.",0.0
And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.,0.0
That's exactly where we find ourselves today.,0.0
There's a sense of American occupation.,0.0
The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry.,0.0
We didn't guard the nuclear facilities.,0.0
"We didn't guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction.",0.0
We didn't guard the borders.,0.0
"Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.",1.0
I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.,0.0
And I believe our troops need other allies helping.,0.0
I'm going to hold that summit.,0.0
"I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.",0.0
I think it's worthy for a follow-up.,0.0
"My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm's way, ""wrong war, wrong place, wrong time""?",0.0
"Not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a ""great diversion.""",0.0
"As well, help is on the way, but it's certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it.",1.0
Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops.,0.0
"Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.",0.0
But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.,1.0
Which is worse?,0.0
"I believe that when you know something's going wrong, you make it right.",0.0
That's what I learned in Vietnam.,0.0
When I came back from that war I saw that it was wrong.,0.0
"Some people don't like the fact that I stood up to say no, but I did.",0.0
And that's what I did with that vote.,0.0
And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.,0.0
"No, and they don't have to, providing we have the leadership that we put -- that I'm offering.",0.0
I believe that we have to win this.,0.0
The president and I have always agreed on that.,0.0
"And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.",0.0
But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength.,0.0
"Then the president, in fact, promised them.",0.0
"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully.",0.0
We will proceed cautiously.,0.0
We will not make war inevitable.,0.0
"We will go with our allies.""",0.0
He didn't do any of those things.,0.0
They didn't do the planning.,0.0
They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.,0.0
They avoided even the advice of their own general.,0.0
"Instead of listening to him, they retired him.",0.0
"The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, ""Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor.""",1.0
That's what we have here.,0.0
And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.,0.0
They do have stakes in it.,0.0
They've always had stakes in it.,0.0
The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war.,0.0
The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep.,0.0
But this president hasn't even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states.,0.0
"In fact, he's done the opposite.",0.0
He pushed them away.,0.0
"When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, ""No, no, we'll go do this alone.""",0.0
"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction.""",0.0
That's not a way to invite people.,0.0
That's totally absurd.,1.0
"Of course, the U. N. was invited in.",0.0
And we support the U. N. efforts there.,0.0
They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.,0.0
But they're now back in helping with elections.,0.0
My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.,0.0
What's he say to Tony Blair?,0.0
What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?,0.0
You can't expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.,0.0
"Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.",0.0
"So what's the message going to be: ""Please join us in Iraq.",0.0
For a grand diversion.,0.0
"Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time? """,0.0
I know how these people think.,0.0
I deal with them all the time.,0.0
I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently.,0.0
"They're not going to follow somebody who says, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.""",0.0
They're not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.,0.0
They're not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.,0.0
"And finally, he says we ought to have a summit.",0.0
Japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged.,0.0
"And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute.",0.0
"And there's going to be an Arab summit, of the neighborhood countries.",0.0
And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.,0.0
"The United Nations, Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell.",0.0
And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction.,0.0
It was always American-run.,0.0
"Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.",0.0
That's not a grand coalition.,0.0
We can do better.,0.0
"Well, actually, he forgot Poland.",0.0
"And now there's 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.",0.0
And I honor their sacrifices.,0.0
And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.,1.0
You cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us.,0.0
He called them coerced and the bribed.,1.0
That's not how you bring people together.,0.0
Our coalition is strong.,0.0
"It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.",0.0
"No, what I said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around.",0.0
"But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared.",1.0
"I thought they would stay and fight, but they didn't.",0.0
And now we're fighting them now.,0.0
I understand how hard it is.,0.0
I get the casualty reports every day.,0.0
I see on the TV screens how hard it is.,0.0
But it's necessary work.,0.0
And I'm optimistic.,0.0
"See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time.",0.0
I'm optimistic we'll achieve -- I know we won't achieve if we send mixed signals.,0.0
"I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.",0.0
We've got a plan in place.,0.0
"The plan says there will be elections in January, and there will be.",0.0
"The plan says we'll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are.",0.0
"And it's not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordan's helping train police, UAE is helping train police.",0.0
We've allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts.,0.0
And we're making progress there.,0.0
"And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.",0.0
Japan will be hosting a summit.,0.0
It is hard work.,0.0
It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy.,0.0
"It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.",0.0
And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.,0.0
What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.,1.0
"But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way.",0.0
Those are his words.,0.0
"Now, I would not.",0.0
So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.,0.0
The truth is what good policy is based on.,0.0
It's what leadership is based on.,0.0
The president says that I'm denigrating these troops.,0.0
"I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do.",0.0
"But you can't tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn't anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.",0.0
"You can't tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started -- it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others.",0.0
That's it.,0.0
"And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.",1.0
Talk about mixed messages.,1.0
"The president is the one that said, ""We can't allow countries to get nuclear weapons.""",1.0
They have.,1.0
I'll change that.,0.0
"Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.",0.0
And I try not to.,0.0
I've been -- but I'll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people.,0.0
And I'll tell you exactly how.,0.0
"First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.",0.0
We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition.,0.0
I just described the coalition.,0.0
It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this.,0.0
The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process.,0.0
He didn't.,0.0
"He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily.",1.0
And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.,0.0
They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards.,0.0
"Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully.",0.0
They obviously didn't.,0.0
He misled the American people when he said we'd go to war as a last resort.,0.0
We did not go as a last resort.,0.0
And most Americans know the difference.,0.0
"Now, this has cost us deeply in the world.",0.0
I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.,0.0
"I've worked with those leaders the president talks about, I've worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.",0.0
"And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.",0.0
"And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.",1.0
We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror.,0.0
We need to deny them the recruits.,0.0
We need to deny them the safe havens.,0.0
We need to rebuild our alliances.,0.0
"I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.",1.0
My opponent just said something amazing.,0.0
He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America.,0.0
Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.,0.0
Osama bin Laden doesn't get to decide.,0.0
The American people decide.,1.0
I decided the right action was in Iraq.,0.0
My opponent calls it a mistake.,0.0
It wasn't a mistake.,0.0
He said I misled on Iraq.,0.0
I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.,0.0
I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.,0.0
"I don't think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn't have the judgment to be president.",0.0
I don't think he was misleading.,0.0
I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.,1.0
"As the politics change, his positions change.",1.0
And that's not how a commander in chief acts.,0.0
Let me finish.,0.0
"The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at, the very same intelligence.",0.0
"And when I stood up there and spoke to the Congress, I was speaking off the same intelligence he looked at to make his decisions to support the authorization of force.",0.0
I wasn't misleading when I said he was a threat.,0.0
Nor was I misleading on the day that the president decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy.,0.0
"I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat.",0.0
There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.,0.0
And the president chose the wrong way.,0.0
The only thing consistent about my opponent's position is that he's been inconsistent.,1.0
He changes positions.,0.0
And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win.,0.0
And I expect to win.,0.0
It's necessary we win.,0.0
We're being challenged like never before.,0.0
"And we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.",0.0
"You know, every life is precious.",0.0
Every life matters.,0.0
"You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.",0.0
"You know, I think about Missy Johnson.",1.0
"She and her son Bryan, they came to see me.",1.0
"You know, it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm's way.",1.0
I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband's sacrifice was noble and worthy.,1.0
Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror.,0.0
I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide.,0.0
We must deal with threats before they fully materialize.,0.0
"And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.",0.0
Missy understood that.,0.0
That's what she told me her husband understood.,0.0
"So you say, ""Was it worth it? """,0.0
Every life is precious.,0.0
That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.,0.0
Everybody matters.,0.0
"But I think it's worth it, Jim.",0.0
"I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.",0.0
"And the question, is it worth the cost, reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war.",0.0
"And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors.",0.0
That happened before.,0.0
"And that's one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.",0.0
That is noble.,0.0
That's the most noble thing that anybody can do.,1.0
And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility.,0.0
"Now, we have a choice here.",0.0
"I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U. N. and the elections.",0.0
There's only 25 percent of the people in there.,0.0
They can't have an election right now.,0.0
The president's not getting the job done.,0.0
"So the choice for America is, you can have a plan that I've laid out in four points, each of which I can tell you more about or you can go to johnkerry.com and see more of it; or you have the president's plan, which is four words: more of the same.",0.0
I think my plan is better.,0.0
And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops.,0.0
"I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.",0.0
"Yes, I understand what it means to the commander in chief.",0.0
"And if I were to ever say, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" the troops would wonder, how can I follow this guy?",0.0
"You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, ""Well, this is just a grand diversion.""",0.0
It's not a grand diversion.,0.0
This is an essential that we get it right.,0.0
"And so, the plan he talks about simply won't work.",0.0
"Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it.",0.0
"Now, if you break it, you made a mistake.",0.0
It's the wrong thing to do.,0.0
But you own it.,0.0
And then you've got to fix it and do something with it.,0.0
Now that's what we have to do.,0.0
There's no inconsistency.,0.0
Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.,0.0
"I'm going to get it right for those soldiers, because it's important to Israel, it's important to America, it's important to the world, it's important to the fight on terror.",0.0
But I have a plan to do it.,0.0
He doesn't.,0.0
"The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said.",0.0
I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.,0.0
"I said, if we do the things that I've set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months.",0.0
And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.,0.0
"As I understand it, we're building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they've got a rather permanent concept to them.",0.0
"When you guard the oil ministry, but you don't guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, ""Wow, maybe they're interested in our oil.""",0.0
"Now, the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly.",0.0
And these are the things you have to think through.,0.0
What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground.,0.0
"And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists.",0.0
You have to close the borders.,0.0
You've got to show you're serious in that regard.,0.0
I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq.,0.0
And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace.,0.0
"But that's how we're going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.",0.0
"Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.",0.0
"Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards.",0.0
"""Oops, we haven't done the job.",0.0
"There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.",0.0
"There's going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year.",0.0
"Yes, we're getting the job done.",0.0
"Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.",0.0
"Now, my opponent says he's going to try to change the dynamics on the ground.",0.0
"Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here.",0.0
He is the leader of that country.,0.0
"He's a brave, brave man.",1.0
"When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.",0.0
You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.,0.0
One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet.,0.0
"That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.",0.0
"The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.",0.0
"I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.",0.0
"I reject this notion -- and I'm suggesting my opponent isn't -- I reject the notion that some say that if you're Muslim you can't free, you don't desire freedom.",0.0
"I disagree, strongly disagree with that.",1.0
I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.,0.0
"But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way.",0.0
He has more of the same.,0.0
"Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border.",1.0
That's Allawi's assessment.,1.0
"The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.",1.0
I can do better.,0.0
The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they're coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror.,0.0
They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.,1.0
They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them.,0.0
And those are the stakes.,0.0
And that's why it is essential we not leave.,0.0
That's why it's essential we hold the line.,0.0
That's why it's essential we win.,0.0
And we will.,0.0
Under my leadership we're going to win this war in Iraq.,0.0
I would hope I never have to.,0.0
I understand how hard it is to commit troops.,0.0
Never wanted to commit troops.,0.0
"But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us.",0.0
"I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we'll ever have to use troops.",0.0
But a president must always be willing to use troops.,0.0
It must -- as a last resort.,0.0
I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.,0.0
It was falling apart.,0.0
There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.,0.0
"And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, ""Let the inspectors work, or let's, you know, hope to talk him out.",1.0
"Maybe an 18th resolution would work,"" he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off.",1.0
"There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.",1.0
"So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me.",1.0
And I would hope to never have to use force.,0.0
"But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we've affected the world in a positive way.",0.0
Look at Libya.,0.0
Libya was a threat.,0.0
Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.,0.0
Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.,0.0
"So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to.",0.0
"I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.",0.0
"Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.",0.0
"In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, ""The enemy attacked us.""",0.0
Saddam Hussein didn't attack us.,0.0
Osama bin Laden attacked us.,0.0
Al Qaida attacked us.,0.0
"And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains.",0.0
"With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn't use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world's number one criminal and terrorist.",0.0
"They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.",0.0
That's the enemy that attacked us.,0.0
That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.,0.0
"That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.",0.0
He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger.,0.0
That is just factually incorrect.,0.0
Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war.,0.0
We would have had sanctions.,0.0
We would have had the U. N. inspectors.,0.0
Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.,0.0
"If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, ""What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us? """,0.0
we'd be in a stronger place today.,0.0
"First of all, of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us.",0.0
I know that.,0.0
"And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment.",1.0
It just shows a significant difference of opinion.,0.0
We tried diplomacy.,0.0
We did our best.,0.0
He was hoping to turn a blind eye.,0.0
"And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.",0.0
"He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.",0.0
Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.,0.0
"And while he's been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea's gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.",0.0
Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.,0.0
Darfur has a genocide.,0.0
The world is more dangerous.,0.0
I'd have made a better choice.,0.0
"Let me -- I'm not exactly sure what you mean, ""passes the global test,"" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test.",0.0
"My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.",0.0
My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.,0.0
"Let me tell you one thing I didn't sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion -- the difference of opinions.",0.0
"And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.",0.0
This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial.,0.0
And I wouldn't join it.,0.0
And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.,0.0
But it's the right move not to join a foreign court that could -- where our people could be prosecuted.,0.0
My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court.,0.0
"I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.",1.0
I'm interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it.,0.0
But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.,0.0
"North Korea, first, I do.",0.0
Let me say -- I certainly hope so.,0.0
"Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.",0.0
And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans.,0.0
"And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.",0.0
"And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world's interest.",0.0
"And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China.",0.0
"And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.",0.0
"As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia.",0.0
"So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.",0.0
"And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.",0.0
And I think this will work.,0.0
It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il.,0.0
Thatâ€™s what he wants.,0.0
"He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.",0.0
"On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.",0.0
"We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.",0.0
The IAEA is involved.,0.0
There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.,0.0
I hope we can do it.,0.0
And we've got a good strategy.,0.0
"With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran.",0.0
I believe we could have done better.,0.0
"I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.",0.0
"If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.",0.0
The president did nothing.,1.0
"With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.",0.0
Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.,0.0
And we knew where the fuel rods were.,0.0
And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.,0.0
"Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans.",0.0
The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.,0.0
And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.,0.0
"And for two years, this administration didn't talk at all to North Korea.",0.0
"While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.",0.0
"And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.",0.0
That happened on this president's watch.,0.0
"Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.",1.0
"I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.",0.0
"The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.",1.0
That's exactly what Kim Jong Il wants.,0.0
"And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.",0.0
The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium.,0.0
That's what we caught him doing.,0.0
That's where he was breaking the agreement.,0.0
"Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.",0.0
We can't sanction them any more.,0.0
There are sanctions in place on Iran.,0.0
"And finally, we were a party to the convention -- to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.",0.0
"Well, I'll tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran.",0.0
"Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.",0.0
And that's the difference between the president and me.,0.0
"And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.",0.0
"Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide.",0.0
"And months ago, many of us were pressing for action.",0.0
I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.,0.0
"Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.",0.0
Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support.,0.0
We need to do more than that.,0.0
They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.,0.0
And that's going to require more than is on the table today.,0.0
I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.,0.0
Ask the people in the armed forces today.,1.0
We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.,0.0
"We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.",0.0
So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.,0.0
"That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.",0.0
I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.,0.0
"And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.",0.0
"But I'll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I'd be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda.",0.0
It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.,0.0
"Back to Iran, just for a second.",0.0
It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.,0.0
And Colin Powell so stated.,1.0
We have committed $200 million worth of aid.,0.0
We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.,0.0
We will commit more over time to help.,0.0
We were very much involved at the U. N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.,0.0
"Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.",0.0
I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.,0.0
We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia.,0.0
"We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.",0.0
My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives.,0.0
"And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.",0.0
That's a loaded question.,0.0
"Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry's service to our country.",0.0
I admire the fact that he is a great dad.,0.0
"I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning.",0.0
I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate.,0.0
Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.,0.0
I won't hold it against him that he went to Yale.,0.0
There's nothing wrong with that.,0.0
"My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.",0.0
"He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.",1.0
You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.,0.0
Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.,0.0
Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.,0.0
Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.,0.0
And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.,0.0
I admire his service.,0.0
"But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U. S. president.",0.0
"Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.",0.0
"Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.",0.0
And I share them with him.,0.0
I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.,0.0
And it's tough.,0.0
And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I've watched them.,0.0
I've chuckled a few times at some of their comments.,0.0
I'm trying to put a leash on them.,0.0
I've learned not to do that.,0.0
(LAUGHTER)  And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.,0.0
I think she's a terrific person...,0.0
... and a great first lady.,0.0
But we do have differences.,0.0
I'm not going to talk about a difference of character.,0.0
I don't think that's my job or my business.,0.0
But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.,0.0
"Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.",0.0
But this issue of certainty.,0.0
"It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.",0.0
"It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.",0.0
"What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.",0.0
And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.,0.0
"Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq.",0.0
Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.,0.0
But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.,0.0
"And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.",1.0
"Otherwise, the world won't be better off.",1.0
I have no intention of wilting.,1.0
I've never wilted in my life.,1.0
And I've never wavered in my life.,1.0
"I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.",0.0
He needed to be disarmed.,0.0
But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.,0.0
Nuclear proliferation.,0.0
There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.,0.0
"At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.",0.0
I did a lot of work on this.,0.0
"I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network.",0.0
"And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.",0.0
And the black market sale price was about $250 million.,0.0
"Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.",0.0
"And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.",0.0
We have to do this job.,0.0
"And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.",0.0
The president actually cut the money for it.,0.0
You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.,0.0
And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.,0.0
Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.,1.0
The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.,1.0
It doesn't make sense.,1.0
You talk about mixed messages.,1.0
"We're telling other people, ""You can't have nuclear weapons,"" but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using.",1.0
Not this president.,0.0
"I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.",0.0
And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.,0.0
And we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.,0.0
This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.,0.0
It's our generation's equivalent.,0.0
And I intend to get it done.,0.0
"Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president.",0.0
"Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.",0.0
And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.,0.0
My administration started what's called the Proliferation Security Initiative.,0.0
Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.,0.0
And we've been effective.,0.0
This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.,0.0
We convinced Libya to disarm.,0.0
It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.,0.0
I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.,0.0
And we've got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration.,0.0
We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.,0.0
And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.,0.0
My opponent opposed the missile defenses.,0.0
In the hands of a terrorist enemy.,0.0
"Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.",0.0
"But again, the test or the difference between us, the president has had four years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons.",0.0
"And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.",0.0
"I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.",0.0
"Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.",1.0
It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.,0.0
It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.,1.0
"It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.",1.0
It's a big mistake to do that.,0.0
"We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.",0.0
"And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.",1.0
I don't think that'll work.,0.0
"No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.",0.0
"I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.",0.0
"I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.",0.0
"He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids.",0.0
"That's the nature of the enemy, by the way.",0.0
That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.,0.0
"That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.",0.0
I've got a good relation with Vladimir.,0.0
"I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.",0.0
And so I've told him my opinion.,0.0
"I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.",0.0
Russia is a country in transition.,0.0
"And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.",0.0
And I will continue working with him over the next four years.,0.0
"Well, let me just say quickly that I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation.",0.0
It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.,0.0
I regret what's happened in these past months.,0.0
And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.,0.0
Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.,0.0
His political opposition is being put in jail.,0.0
"And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.",0.0
This is a very important country to us.,0.0
We want a partnership.,0.0
But we always have to stand up for democracy.,0.0
"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now.""",1.0
"Now, I'd like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks.",0.0
Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.,0.0
"Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.",0.0
"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true.",0.0
And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.,0.0
"Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.",0.0
You know my opinion on North Korea.,0.0
I can't say it any more plainly.,0.0
Pardon me?,0.0
"Oh, I'm a pretty calm guy.",0.0
I don't take it personally.,0.0
"You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.",0.0
And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.,0.0
"I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.",0.0
It was a threat.,0.0
That's not the issue.,0.0
The issue is what you do about it.,0.0
"The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U. N. and go to war as a last resort.",0.0
Those words really have to mean something.,0.0
"And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.",0.0
Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.,0.0
It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.,1.0
"Thank you, Jim, very much.",0.0
"Thank you very much to the university, again.",0.0
"Thank you, Mr. President.",0.0
"My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.",0.0
"There's no doubt, I think, about that.",0.0
But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.,0.0
"I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who's the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace.",0.0
"And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they're going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States.",0.0
But I have a difference with this president.,0.0
I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.,0.0
I have a plan for Iraq.,0.0
I believe we can be successful.,0.0
I'm not talking about leaving.,0.0
I'm talking about winning.,0.0
"And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.",0.0
"I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances.",0.0
"I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.",1.0
That's the country that I'm going to fight for.,1.0
And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.,0.0
"I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve.",0.0
Thank you.,0.0
And God bless America.,0.0
"Thank you very much tonight, Jim.",0.0
"If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.",1.0
"That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president.",0.0
The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.,0.0
We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.,0.0
We will reform our military.,0.0
The military will be an all-volunteer army.,0.0
We will continue to stay on the offense.,0.0
We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.,0.0
We'll continue to build our alliances.,0.0
"I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances.",0.0
And we'll continue to spread freedom.,0.0
I believe in the transformational power of liberty.,0.0
I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.,0.0
I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.,0.0
And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.,0.0
We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.,0.0
"We've been challenged, and we've risen to those challenges.",0.0
We've climbed the mighty mountain.,0.0
"I see the valley below, and it's a valley of peace.",0.0
"By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.",0.0
I appreciate your listening tonight.,0.0
I ask for your vote.,0.0
And may God continue to bless our great land.,0.0
"Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.",0.0
"As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.",0.0
Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.,0.0
He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.,0.0
"I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration.",0.0
"There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953.",1.0
Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.,1.0
We think that's pretty good progress.,0.0
Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.,0.0
"Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind.",0.0
"As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.",0.0
And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.,0.0
For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.,0.0
"Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.",0.0
There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.,0.0
There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.,0.0
There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.,0.0
"No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.",0.0
In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.,0.0
In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.,0.0
"Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.",0.0
"Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.",0.0
"What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958.",0.0
"Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.",0.0
"Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.",0.0
"Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.",0.0
In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.,0.0
"Mr. Lodge, on ""Meet the Press"" a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident.",0.0
The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.,0.0
But they were not in accordance with international law.,0.0
"And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.",0.0
The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.,0.0
We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.,0.0
The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.,0.0
The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.,0.0
That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.,0.0
"I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action.",0.0
It's not appeasement.,0.0
It's not soft.,0.0
I believe we should be stronger than we now are.,0.0
I believe we should have a stronger military force.,0.0
I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.,0.0
"But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.",1.0
I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.,0.0
"First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.",0.0
He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference.,0.0
"Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.",0.0
The United States is a strong country.,0.0
"Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.",0.0
"But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev.",0.0
"Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred.",0.0
This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.,0.0
We all remember Pearl Harbor.,0.0
We cannot afford an intelligence gap.,0.0
And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.,0.0
"I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort.",0.0
And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.,0.0
My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.,0.0
I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.,0.0
"And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.",0.0
"Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.",0.0
"Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools.",0.0
That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.,0.0
"And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.",0.0
"And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.",0.0
Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.,0.0
I have talked to Negro mothers.,0.0
I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola.,1.0
"This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.",0.0
"So, under the circumstances, what do we do?",0.0
Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.,0.0
"Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?",0.0
Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.,1.0
"I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.",0.0
"I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens.",0.0
"And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.",0.0
"Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?",0.0
Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question.,0.0
"Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?",0.0
"He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.",0.0
"He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color.",0.0
"Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights.",0.0
These are the great questions: equality of education in school.,0.0
"These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.",0.0
What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?,0.0
"Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president's pen.",0.0
What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?,0.0
Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.,0.0
And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.,0.0
"And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.",0.0
"Secondly, as an executive leader.",0.0
There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.,0.0
The right to vote is basic.,0.0
I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.,0.0
"Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.",0.0
Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.,0.0
And that's in all sections of the United States.,0.0
"And then fourthly, as a moral leader.",0.0
We are in a very difficult time.,0.0
We need all the talent we can get.,0.0
We sit on a conspicuous stage.,0.0
We are a goldfish bowl before the world.,0.0
We have to practice what we preach.,1.0
We set a very high standard for ourselves.,0.0
The Communists do not.,0.0
They set a low standard of materialism.,0.0
"We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.",0.0
I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.,0.0
"Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.",0.0
I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.,0.0
I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.,0.0
I would hope an incident like that would not happen.,0.0
"I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.",0.0
Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision.,0.0
"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.""",1.0
And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.,0.0
"Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.",0.0
But let's look at the performance.,0.0
"When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.",0.0
Let me s- look also at what I did.,0.0
I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it.,0.0
Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.,0.0
And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.,0.0
"Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.",1.0
All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.,0.0
What we need is action.,0.0
"And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.",0.0
"Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.",0.0
"And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.",1.0
"Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.",0.0
"First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low.",0.0
Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.,0.0
"I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.",0.0
"Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.",0.0
We were on one side; they were on the other side.,0.0
What happened?,0.0
There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.,0.0
Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.,0.0
That's a test of prestige.,0.0
"Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.",0.0
Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.,0.0
In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.,0.0
"It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.",0.0
What do we need?,0.0
What tools do we need to fight us?,0.0
"Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.",0.0
Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.,0.0
"I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.",0.0
They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.,0.0
"Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.",1.0
So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.,1.0
It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.,0.0
But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.,0.0
Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.,0.0
I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces.,0.0
"Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.",0.0
Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it.,0.0
We have not maintained our position and our prestige.,0.0
"A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.",0.0
Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.,1.0
"The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.",0.0
We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.,1.0
"And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.",0.0
"Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.",0.0
"I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.",0.0
This permits them to maintain their self-respect.,0.0
It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.,0.0
And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.,0.0
I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.,0.0
"And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.",0.0
"We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed.",0.0
"And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.",0.0
"And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.",0.0
I think the United States can afford to do these things.,0.0
I think that we could not afford not to do these things.,0.0
This goes to our survival.,0.0
"And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.",0.0
"I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.",0.0
I believe we can do it.,0.0
"If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.",0.0
Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.,0.0
"But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.",1.0
We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.,0.0
"We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.",0.0
We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.,0.0
"We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.",0.0
This we must get across to the world.,0.0
"And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.",0.0
The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.,0.0
This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.,1.0
We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.,0.0
We must stand for our ideals.,0.0
To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.,0.0
"Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.",1.0
Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.,1.0
On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.,1.0
"So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.",0.0
I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.,0.0
"Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.",0.0
"In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.",0.0
It also exists among minority groups.,0.0
"If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.",0.0
"That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens.",0.0
"Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.",0.0
I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.,0.0
"But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.",0.0
This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.,0.0
I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.,0.0
So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.,0.0
But I do not expect it to come.,0.0
Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.,0.0
I'm very familiar with it.,0.0
It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five.,0.0
I was the floor manager.,0.0
"We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.",0.0
We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.,0.0
Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.,0.0
Our bill was far more effective.,0.0
The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.,0.0
"Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.",0.0
I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.,0.0
"Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.",0.0
Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.,0.0
"Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.",0.0
"If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.",0.0
One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.,0.0
The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.,0.0
Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.,0.0
The question is what we're going to do in the future.,0.0
I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.,0.0
In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.,0.0
I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.,0.0
Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.,0.0
Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.,0.0
"He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.",0.0
I disagree.,0.0
"And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.",0.0
That's the great issue.,0.0
President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.,0.0
And that's the debate.,0.0
That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.,1.0
"I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.",0.0
"If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.",0.0
"In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.",0.0
We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.,0.0
Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.,0.0
We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.,0.0
Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.,0.0
He's had experience in it.,0.0
"And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.",1.0
I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.,0.0
"Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.",0.0
In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.,0.0
I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.,0.0
Let me make my position cl ear.,0.0
I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.,0.0
I'm proud of the record of this Administration.,0.0
I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.,0.0
Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.,0.0
But what does he offer?,0.0
He offers retreads of programs that failed.,0.0
"I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.",0.0
"And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.",1.0
I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.,0.0
I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.,0.0
"And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.",0.0
"No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan.",0.0
It would not be appropriate for me to do so.,0.0
"The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.",0.0
"As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.",0.0
I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.,0.0
"I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.",0.0
We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.,0.0
"There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.",0.0
He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.,0.0
"Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.",0.0
"Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.",0.0
"So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.",0.0
I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.,0.0
It - my view is the same as his.,0.0
Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.,0.0
"That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.",0.0
"If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.",0.0
"Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.",0.0
It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.,0.0
It's going to be a test of our strength.,0.0
"And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.",1.0
"On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.",0.0
"I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.",0.0
"Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.",0.0
"In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.",0.0
"If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.",0.0
I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.,0.0
I'm talking about a national mood.,1.0
I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.,1.0
"Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States.",0.0
That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.,0.0
"If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.",0.0
"So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.",0.0
So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.,0.0
We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.,0.0
"And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.",0.0
"And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.",0.0
I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.,0.0
Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.,0.0
"Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.",0.0
In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.,0.0
I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.,0.0
I hope not.,0.0
I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.,0.0
But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.,0.0
"Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that.",1.0
"I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.",0.0
"The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors.",0.0
But it isn't going to be working that way.,0.0
You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.,0.0
"After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money.",0.0
I did.,0.0
"And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary.",0.0
What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.,0.0
"Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy.",0.0
He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat.,0.0
And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?,0.0
"In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.",1.0
"I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.",0.0
"But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.",0.0
I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.,0.0
I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.,0.0
I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.,0.0
Now this just wasn't true.,0.0
"Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.",1.0
"But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world.",0.0
"We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history.",0.0
"Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.",0.0
It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.,0.0
Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.,0.0
"And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way.",0.0
"But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate.",0.0
And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.,0.0
"Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.",0.0
"Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.",0.0
And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.,0.0
Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.,0.0
You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.,0.0
You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.,0.0
I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.,0.0
And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.,0.0
And we ought to try to meet the problem.,0.0
"Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.",0.0
They're wholly inaccurate.,0.0
I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.,0.0
"Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.",0.0
So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.,0.0
"Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa.",0.0
I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.,0.0
"These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.",0.0
We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.,0.0
We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.,0.0
But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.,0.0
"Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.",1.0
"Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.",1.0
General Ridgway has said the same thing.,1.0
"I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.",0.0
"One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.",0.0
I believe that we should defend Formosa.,0.0
We should come to its defense.,0.0
"Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.",0.0
It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.,0.0
"But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.",0.0
I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.,0.0
I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.,0.0
I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.,0.0
But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.,0.0
"And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.",0.0
I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.,0.0
"I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.",0.0
Generals testified to that.,0.0
"And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.",0.0
I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.,0.0
But it didn't mean that.,0.0
We had to go in when they came in.,0.0
"Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.",0.0
It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.,0.0
It's the principle involved.,0.0
These two islands are in the area of freedom.,0.0
The Nationalists have these two islands.,0.0
We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.,0.0
"If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa.",0.0
In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.,1.0
I am against it.,0.0
"I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.",0.0
"Gwen, I want to thank you, and I want to thank the folks here at Case Western Reserve for hosting this tonight.",0.0
"It's a very important event, and they've done a superb job of putting it together.",0.0
It's important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror.,0.0
"And, after 9/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror.",0.0
"And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons.",0.0
"Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida.",0.0
"Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director's testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship.",1.0
The effort that we've mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction.,0.0
The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.,1.0
What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do.,0.0
"If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action.",0.0
And we did exactly the right thing.,0.0
Thank you.,0.0
"Thank you, Gwen, for moderating this debate.",0.0
Thank you to the folks of Case Western and all the people in Ohio for having us here.,0.0
"Mr. Vice President, you are still not being straight with the American people.",0.0
"I mean, the reality you and George Bush continue to tell people, first, that things are going well in Iraq -- the American people don't need us to explain this to them, they see it on their television every single day.",0.0
We lost more troops in September than we lost in August; lost more in August than we lost in July; lost more in July than we lost in June.,0.0
"The truth is, our men and women in uniform have been heroic.",0.0
Our military has done everything they've been asked to do.,0.0
And it's not just me that sees the mess in Iraq.,0.0
"There are Republican leaders, like John McCain, like Richard Lugar, like Chuck Hagel, who have said Iraq is a mess and it's getting worse.",1.0
"And when they were asked why, Richard Lugar said because of the incompetence of the administration.",0.0
What Paul Bremer said yesterday is they didn't have enough troops to secure the country.,0.0
They also didn't have a plan to win the peace.,0.0
They also didn't put the alliances together to make this successful.,0.0
We need a fresh start.,0.0
"We need a president who will speed up the training of the Iraqis, get more staff in for doing that.",0.0
We need to speed up the reconstruction so the Iraqis see some tangible benefit.,0.0
"We need a new president who has the credibility, which John Kerry has, to bring others into this effort.",0.0
We've made significant progress in Iraq.,0.0
We've stood up a new government that's been in power now only 90 days.,0.0
"The notion of additional troops is talked about frequently, but the point of success in Iraq will be reached when we have turned governance over to the Iraqi people; they have been able to establish a democratic government.",0.0
They're well on their way to doing that.,0.0
They will have free elections next January for the first time in history.,0.0
"We also are actively, rapidly training Iraqis to take on the security responsibility.",0.0
Those two steps are crucial to success in Iraq.,0.0
"And I'm confident that, in fact, we'll get the job done.",0.0
Yes.,0.0
"Mr. Vice President, there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein.",0.0
The 9/11 Commission has said it.,0.0
Your own secretary of state has said it.,0.0
And you've gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection.,0.0
There is not.,0.0
And in fact the CIA is now about to report that the connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein is tenuous at best.,0.0
"And, in fact, the secretary of defense said yesterday that he knows of no hard evidence of the connection.",0.0
We need to be straight with the American people.,0.0
Here's what it means: It means that Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted.,0.0
John Kerry and I have consistently said that.,0.0
That's why we voted for the resolution.,0.0
But it also means it needed to be done the right way.,0.0
"And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction; that we didn't take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th.",0.0
"Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, was the right thing to do.",0.0
That was the right decision.,0.0
And our military performed terrifically there.,0.0
But we had Osama bin Laden cornered at Tora Bora.,0.0
We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available.,0.0
We had the finest military in the world on the ground.,0.0
And what did we do?,0.0
We turned -- this is the man who masterminded the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in American history.,1.0
And what did the administration decide to do?,0.0
"They gave the responsibility of capturing and/or killing Saddam -- I mean Osama bin Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, had been working with Osama bin Laden.",0.0
Our point in this is not complicated: We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden.,0.0
We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq.,0.0
Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying.,0.0
The 9/11 Commission has said that's true.,0.0
Colin Powell has said it's true.,0.0
But the vice president keeps suggesting that there is.,0.0
"And, in fact, any connection with Al Qaida is tenuous at best.",0.0
The senator has got his facts wrong.,0.0
"I have not suggested there's a connection between Iraq and 9/11, but there's clearly an established Iraqi track record with terror.",0.0
"And the point is that that's the place where you're most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years.",1.0
"Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror.",0.0
They've got a very limited view about how to use U. S. military forces to defend America.,0.0
We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U. S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States.,1.0
That's part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U. N. approval.,1.0
"Then, in the mid-'80s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs.",1.0
"In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm.",1.0
It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues.,1.0
A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues.,0.0
"And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn't again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida.",0.0
"Gwen, we've never let up on Osama bin Laden from day one.",0.0
We've actively and aggressively pursued him.,0.0
We've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan.,0.0
"We'll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I'm confident eventually we'll get him.",0.0
"The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we've done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization.",0.0
"John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over.",1.0
"Here we are, two and a half years later, we're four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan.",0.0
"We've got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women.",0.0
That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December.,0.0
"We've made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago.",0.0
He just got it wrong.,0.0
"The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary.",0.0
We're standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security.,0.0
But they're making significant progress.,0.0
They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever.,0.0
Schools are open.,0.0
Young girls are going to school.,0.0
Women are even eligible to run for office.,0.0
"This is major, major progress.",0.0
"There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it.",0.0
Freedom is the best antidote to terror.,0.0
Someone did get it wrong.,0.0
But it wasn't John Kerry and John Edwards.,0.0
They got it wrong.,0.0
"When we had Osama bin Laden cornered, they left the job to the Afghan warlords.",0.0
"They then diverted their attention from the very people who attacked us, who were at the center of the war on terror, and so Osama bin Laden is still at large.",0.0
"Now, I want to go back to something the vice president said just a minute ago, because these distortions are continuing.",0.0
He said that -- made mention of this global test.,0.0
"What John Kerry said -- and it's just as clear as day to anybody who was listening -- he said: We will find terrorists where they are and kill them before they ever do harm to the American people, first.",0.0
We will keep this country safe.,0.0
"He defended this country as a young man, he will defend this country as president of the United States.",0.0
He also said very clearly that he will never give any country veto power over the security of the United States of America.,0.0
"Now, I know the vice president would like to pretend that wasn't said, and the president would too.",0.0
But the reality is it was said.,0.0
"Here's what's actually happened in Afghanistan, regardless of this rosy scenario that they paint on Afghanistan, just like they do with Iraq.",1.0
What's actually happened is they're now providing 75 percent of the world's opium.,0.0
"Not only are they providing 75 percent of the world's opium, large-cut parts of the country are under the control of drug lords and warlords.",0.0
Big parts of the country are still insecure.,0.0
"And the reality is the part of Afghanistan, eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is, is one of the hardest places to control and the most insecure, Gwen.",0.0
Twenty years ago we had a similar situation in El Salvador.,0.0
"We had -- guerrilla insurgency controlled roughly a third of the country, 75,000 people dead, and we held free elections.",0.0
I was there as an observer on behalf of the Congress.,0.0
"The human drive for freedom, the determination of these people to vote, was unbelievable.",0.0
"And the terrorists would come in and shoot up polling places; as soon as they left, the voters would come back and get in line and would not be denied the right to vote.",0.0
And today El Salvador is a whale of a lot better because we held free elections.,0.0
The power of that concept is enormous.,0.0
"And it will apply in Afghanistan, and it will apply as well in Iraq.",0.0
The vice president just said that we should focus on state sponsors of terrorism.,0.0
Iran has moved forward with its nuclear weapons program.,0.0
They're more dangerous today than they were four years ago.,1.0
"North Korea has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program, gone from one to two nuclear weapons to six to eight nuclear weapons.",0.0
"This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet.",1.0
It's a mistake.,0.0
"We should not only not lift them, we should strengthen those sanctions.",0.0
"Well, let me say, first, he said in the same segment -- I don't remember precisely where it was connected with what you just read -- but he said, point blank, ""We will never give anyone a veto over the security of the United States of America.""",0.0
What he's saying is we're going to go back to the proud tradition of the United States of America and presidents of the United States of America for the last 50 to 75 years.,0.0
"First, we're going to actually tell the American people the truth.",0.0
We're going to tell them the truth about what's happening.,0.0
"We're not going to suggest to them that things are going well in Iraq or anyplace else when, in fact, they're not.",0.0
We're going to make sure that the American people know the truth about why we are using force and what the explanation for it is.,0.0
And it's not just the American people.,0.0
"Because the reality is, for America to lead, for America to do what it's done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office, it is critical that we be credible.",0.0
"It is critical that they believe that when America takes action, they can trust what we're doing, what we say, what we say at the United Nations, what we say in direct conversations with leaders of the world -- of other countries.",0.0
"They need to know that the credibility of the United States is always good, because they will not follow us without that.",0.0
"And unfortunately, we're seeing the consequences of that right now.",0.0
It's one of the reasons that we're having so much difficulty getting others involved in the effort in Iraq.,0.0
"You know, we've taken 90 percent of the coalition casualties.",0.0
American taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in Iraq.,0.0
And we see the result of there not being a coalition: The first Gulf war cost America $5 billion.,0.0
We're at $200 billion and counting.,0.0
John Kerry will never give up control over the security of the United States of America to any other country.,0.0
We will not outsource our responsibility to keep this country safe.,0.0
"With respect to the cost, it wasn't $200 billion.",0.0
You probably weren't there to vote for that.,0.0
The rest of it's for Afghanistan and the global war on terror.,0.0
The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate.,0.0
"That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we've got, but, you know, better than 40 percent.",0.0
"So your facts are just wrong, Senator.",0.0
You also have a situation where you talk about credibility.,0.0
"It's awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time.",0.0
"You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor.",0.0
You're not credible on Iraq because of the enormous inconsistencies that John Kerry and you have cited time after time after time during the course of the campaign.,0.0
"Whatever the political pressures of the moment requires, that's where you're at.",0.0
"But you've not been consistent, and there's no indication at all that John Kerry has the conviction to successfully carry through on the war on terror.",0.0
What the vice president has just said is just a complete distortion.,1.0
The American people saw John Kerry on Thursday night.,0.0
They don't need the vice president or the president to tell them what they saw.,0.0
"They saw a man who was strong, who had conviction, who is resolute, who made it very clear that he will do everything that has to be done to find terrorists, to keep the American people safe.",1.0
"He laid out his plan for success in Iraq, made it clear that we were committed to success in Iraq.",0.0
"We have to be, because we have troops on the ground there and because they have created a haven for terrorists.",0.0
"Your rhetoric, Senator, would be a lot more credible if there was a record to back it up.",1.0
There isn't.,1.0
"And you cannot use ""talk tough"" during the course of a 90-minute debate in a presidential campaign to obscure a 30-year record in the United States Senate and, prior to that by John Kerry, who has consistently come down on the wrong side of all the major defense issues that he's faced as a public official.",0.0
"I'm saying specifically that I don't believe he has the qualities we need in a commander in chief because I don't think, based on his record, that he would pursue the kind of aggressive policies that need to be pursued if we're going to defeat these terrorists.",0.0
We need to battle them overseas so we don't have to battle them here at home.,1.0
I'm not challenging John Kerry's patriotism.,0.0
"I said in my acceptance speech in New York City at the Republican convention that we respected his service in Vietnam, and I got applause for that.",0.0
We've never criticized his patriotism.,0.0
What we've questioned is his judgment.,0.0
"And his judgment's flawed, and the record's there for anybody who wants to look at it.",0.0
"In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces.",0.0
"When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and '91, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq.",0.0
"The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn't display the qualities of somebody who has conviction.",1.0
"And with respect to this particular operation, we've seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed -- body armor, spare parts, ammunition -- they voted against it.",0.0
I couldn't figure out why that happened initially.,0.0
"And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record.",0.0
"So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti-war vote and they voted against the troops.",0.0
"Now if they couldn't stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaida?",0.0
One thing that's very clear is that a long resume does not equal good judgment.,0.0
"I mean, we've seen over and over and over the misjudgments made by this administration.",0.0
"I want to go back to what the vice president just said, because it's a continuation of the things he's been doing, unfortunately, on the campaign trail; it's a continuation of what he began his first answer with tonight.",0.0
John Kerry has voted for the biggest military appropriations bill in the country's history.,0.0
John Kerry has voted for the biggest intelligence appropriations in the country's history.,0.0
"This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones he's criticizing John Kerry for voting against.",0.0
"These are weapons systems, a big chunk of which, the vice president himself suggested we get rid of after the Cold War.",0.0
The reality is that John Kerry has consistently supported the very men that he served with in Vietnam and led.,0.0
"On the $87 billion, it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peace.",0.0
We're seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now.,0.0
"We stood up and said: For our troops, we must have a plan to win the peace.",0.0
"We also thought it was wrong to have a $20 billion fund out of which $7.5 billion was going to go to a no-bid contract for Halliburton, the vice president's former company.",0.0
It was wrong then.,0.0
It's wrong now.,0.0
"Well, Gwen, I think the record speaks for itself.",0.0
These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad.,0.0
We have not seen the kind of consistency that a commander in chief has to have in order to be a leader in wartime and in order to be able to see the strategy through to victory.,0.0
"If we want to win the war on terror, it seems to me it's pretty clear the choice is George Bush, not John Kerry.",0.0
"Had they had time to do their job, they would have discovered what we now know, that in fact Saddam Hussein had no weapons, that in fact Saddam Hussein has no connection with 9/11, that in fact Saddam Hussein has little or no connection with Al Qaida.",0.0
"Well, let's start with what we know.",0.0
What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need -- dramatically different than the first Gulf War.,0.0
"We know that they haven't done it, and we know they can't do it.",0.0
"They didn't, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war.",0.0
"They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences.",0.0
"What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq -- and we have a plan for Iraq.",0.0
They have a plan for Iraq too: more of the same.,0.0
We have a plan for success.,0.0
And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military.,0.0
We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training.,0.0
"Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what's happening.",0.0
"And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them.",0.0
It's so dangerous on the ground that they can't be trained there.,0.0
We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training.,0.0
We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process.,0.0
That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time.,0.0
"Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there.",0.0
"Now, that's compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground.",0.0
"You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq.",0.0
"And they keep saying the election's on schedule, this is going to happen.",0.0
The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success.,0.0
"Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition.",0.0
"Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said.",0.0
He attacks us about the troops.,0.0
"They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed.",0.0
They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed.,0.0
"While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay.",0.0
This is the height of hypocrisy.,0.0
"Well, Gwen, it's hard to know where to start; there are so many inaccuracies there.",0.0
The fact of the matter is the troops wouldn't have what they have today if you guys had had your way.,0.0
You talk about internationalizing the effort.,0.0
They don't have a plan.,0.0
"Basically, it's an echo.",0.0
You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in '91 was far stronger than this.,0.0
No.,0.0
We had 34 countries then; we've got 30 today.,0.0
We've got troops beside us.,0.0
"It's hard, after John Kerry referred to our allies as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send troops and to participate in this process.",0.0
"In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it's the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops.",0.0
Makes no sense at all.,0.0
It's totally inconsistent.,0.0
There isn't a plan there.,0.0
"Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi.",0.0
He came recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with the speaker of the House.,0.0
"And John Kerry rushed out immediately after his speech was over with, where he came and he thanked America for our contributions and our sacrifice and pledged to hold those elections in January, went out and demeaned him, criticized him, challenged his credibility.",0.0
That is not the way to win friends and allies.,0.0
You're never going to add to the coalition with that kind of attitude.,0.0
The vice president suggests that we have the same number of countries involved now that we had in the first Gulf War.,0.0
The first Gulf War cost the American people $5 billion.,0.0
"And regardless of what the vice president says, we're at $200 billion and counting.",0.0
"Not only that, 90 percent of the coalition casualties, Mr. Vice President, the coalition casualties, are American casualties.",0.0
It is the direct result of the failures of this administration.,0.0
Classic example.,0.0
He won't count the sacrifice and the contribution of Iraqi allies.,0.0
It's their country.,0.0
They're in the fight.,0.0
They're increasingly the ones out there putting their necks on the line to take back their country from the terrorists and the old regime elements that are still left.,0.0
They're doing a superb job.,0.0
It is indeed.,0.0
You cannot succeed in this effort if you're not willing to recognize the enormous contribution the Iraqis are increasingly making to their own future.,0.0
"We'll win when they take on responsibility for governance, which they're doing, and when the take on responsibility for their own security, which they increasingly are doing.",0.0
"Well, let me speak, first of all, to what the vice president just said, and then I'll answer that question.",0.0
"This, unfortunately -- what the vice president is telling people is inconsistent with everything they see every single day.",0.0
"It's a continuation of, ""Well, there's a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein.""",0.0
It's not true.,0.0
It's a continuation of at least insinuating that there's some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein.,0.0
"It's saying to the American people, as the president said last Thursday, and the vice president continues to say tonight, that things are going well in Iraq, contrary to what people who have been there have seen, including Republican leaders, contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day -- Americans being kidnapped, people being beheaded, parts of the country under the control of insurgents, even today, under the control of the insurgents.",0.0
"The vice president has still not said anything about what Mr. Bremer said, about the failure to have adequate troops, the failure to be able to secure the country in the short term.",0.0
"You know, remember ""shock and awe""?",0.0
Look at where we are now.,0.0
"It is a direct result of the failure to plan, the failure to have others involved in this effort.",0.0
This is not an accident.,0.0
"Now, let me go back to your question.",0.0
"If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we can't be dragged kicking and screaming to it.",0.0
One thing that everybody does agree on is that 9/11 did change things.,0.0
But what's happened is this administration opposed the creation of a 9/11 Commission to find out why it happened and what we needed to do.,0.0
"They opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, and then they were for it.",0.0
We can't react that way.,0.0
We must be more aggressive.,0.0
"With John Kerry as president of the United States, we are committed to immediately implementing all of the reforms suggested by the 9/11 Commission, so that we have the information we need to find terrorists and crush them before they hurt us.",0.0
"Gwen, the story that appeared today about this report is one I asked for.",0.0
I ask an awful lot of questions as part of my job as vice president.,0.0
A CIA spokesman was quoted in that story as saying they had not yet reached the bottom line and there is still debate over this question of the relationship between Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein.,0.0
The report also points out that at one point some of Zarqawi's people were arrested.,0.0
"Saddam personally intervened to have them released, supposedly at the request of Zarqawi  But let's look at what we know about Mr. Zarqawi.",0.0
"We know he was running a terrorist camp, training terrorists in Afghanistan prior to 9/11.",0.0
We know that when we went into Afghanistan that he then migrated to Baghdad.,0.0
"He set up shop in Baghdad, where he oversaw the poisons facility up at Khurmal (ph), where the terrorists were developing ricin and other deadly substances to use.",0.0
We know he's still in Baghdad today.,0.0
He is responsible for most of the major car bombings that have killed or maimed thousands of people.,1.0
He's the one you will see on the evening news beheading hostages.,1.0
"He is, without question, a bad guy.",0.0
"He is, without question, a terrorist.",0.0
"He was, in fact, in Baghdad before the war, and he's in Baghdad now after the war.",0.0
The fact of the matter is that this is exactly the kind of track record we've seen over the years.,0.0
"We have to deal with Zarqawi by taking him out, and that's exactly what we'll do.",0.0
"No, I do not.",0.0
"And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions.",0.0
"What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there's a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don't have any impact, except to penalize American companies.",0.0
We've got sanctions on Iran now.,0.0
We may well want to go to the U. N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don't live up to their obligations under the initial -- International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty.,0.0
"We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U. N. Security Council.",0.0
"We're working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who've been negotiating with the Iranians.",0.0
We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency.,0.0
"And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran's living up to their commitments and obligations.",0.0
"And if they aren't, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U. N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go.",0.0
"We're addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around.",0.0
"One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done.",0.0
This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that.,0.0
We've made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation.,0.0
And we'll continue to press very hard on the North Koreans and the Iranians as well.,0.0
"Well, the vice president talks about there being a member, or someone associated with Al Qaida, in Iraq.",0.0
There are 60 countries who have members of Al Qaida in them.,0.0
How many of those countries are we going to invade?,0.0
"Not only that, he talks about Iran.",0.0
The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch.,0.0
They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans.,0.0
"Now, the vice president, as you pointed out, spoke out loudly for lifting the sanctions on Iraq.",0.0
"John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq, including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary, offshore subsidiaries to do business with Iran.",0.0
"I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion, and you raised it in this question.",0.0
"This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton.",1.0
Here's why we didn't think Halliburton should have a no-bid contract.,0.0
"While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay.",1.0
"They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States.",0.0
They're now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time.,0.0
"Not only that, they've gotten a $7.5 billion no-bid contract in Iraq, and instead of part of their money being withheld, which is the way it's normally done, because they're under investigation, they've continued to get their money.",0.0
"I can respond, Gwen, but it's going to take more than 30 seconds.",0.0
They know the charges are false.,0.0
"They know that if you go, for example, to factcheck.com (sic), an independent Web site sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania, you can get the specific details with respect to Halliburton.",0.0
"It's an effort that they've made repeatedly to try to confuse the voters and to raise questions, but there's no substance to the charges.",0.0
These are the facts.,0.0
"The facts are the vice president's company that he was CEO of, that did business with sworn enemies of the United States, paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false financial information, is under investigation for bribing foreign officials.",0.0
"The same company that got a $7.5 billion no-bid contract, the rule is that part of their money is supposed to be withheld when they're under investigation, as they are now, for having overcharged the American taxpayer, but they're getting every dime of their money.",0.0
I'm happy to let voters make their own decision about this.,0.0
"Well, first of all, I do agree that we've been largely absent, not entirely absent, but largely absent from the peace-making process over the last four years.",0.0
And let me just say a couple of preliminary things and then talk about where we are now.,0.0
"First, the Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves.",0.0
They have an obligation to defend themselves.,0.0
"I mean, if I can, just for a moment, tell you a personal story.",0.0
"I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, actually three years ago, in August of 2001, staying at the King David Hotel.",0.0
"We left in the morning, headed to the airport to leave, and later in the day I found out that that same day, not far from where we were staying, the Sbarro Pizzeria was hit by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem.",0.0
Six children were killed.,0.0
What are the Israeli people supposed to do?,0.0
"How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists?",1.0
They have not only the right but the obligation to defend themselves.,0.0
"Now, we know that the prime minister has made a decision, a historic decision, to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza.",0.0
It's important for America to participate in helping with that process.,0.0
And Israel has a right to defend itself.,0.0
They don't have a partner for peace right now.,0.0
"They certainly don't have a partner in Arafat, and they need a legitimate partner for peace.",0.0
"And I might add, it is very important for America to crack down on the Saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9/11.",0.0
"And it's important for America to confront the situation in Iran, because Iran is an enormous threat to Israel and to the Israeli people.",1.0
"Gwen, I want to go back to the last comment, and then I'll come back to Israel-Palestine.",0.0
The reason they keep trying to attack Halliburton is because they want to obscure their own record.,1.0
"And Senator, frankly, you have a record in the Senate that's not very distinguished.",0.0
"You've missed 33 out of 36 meetings in the Judiciary Committee, almost 70 percent of the meetings of the Intelligence Committee.",0.0
"You've missed a lot of key votes: on tax policy, on energy, on Medicare reform.",0.0
"Your hometown newspaper has taken to calling you ""Senator Gone.""",0.0
You've got one of the worst attendance records in the United States Senate.,0.0
"Now, in my capacity as vice president, I am the president of Senate, the presiding officer.",0.0
I'm up in the Senate most Tuesdays when they're in session.,0.0
The first time I ever met you was when you walked on the stage tonight.,0.0
"In respect to Israel and Palestine, Gwen, the suicide bombers, in part, were generated by Saddam Hussein, who paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers.",0.0
I personally think one of the reasons that we don't have as many suicide attacks today in Israel as we've had in the past is because Saddam is no longer in business.,1.0
We've been strong supporters of Israel.,0.0
The president stepped forward and put in place a policy basically that said we will support the establishment of two states.,0.0
First president ever to say we'll establish and support a Palestinian state nextdoor to Israelis.,0.0
"But first, there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with.",0.0
There has to be reform of the Palestinian system.,0.0
I know that won't come as a shock.,0.0
"The vice president, I'm surprised to hear him talk about records.",1.0
"When he was one of 435 members of the United States House, he was one of 10 to vote against Head Start, one of four to vote against banning plastic weapons that can pass through metal detectors.",0.0
He voted against the Department of Education.,0.0
He voted against funding for Meals on Wheels for seniors.,0.0
He voted against a holiday for Martin Luther King.,0.0
He voted against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela in South Africa.,0.0
It's amazing to hear him criticize either my record or John Kerry's.,0.0
"And frankly, it's not very distinguished.",0.0
I think it goes to Senator Edwards.,0.0
He's the one who didn't talk about it.,0.0
"Well, Gwen, there are several things that I think need to be done and are being done.",0.0
"We've, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack.",0.0
"But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president's already working on.",0.0
I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs.,0.0
"There's no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family.",0.0
"To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business.",0.0
And that means we've got to deal effectively with tax policy.,0.0
We've got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society.,0.0
"We've got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process.",0.0
"I'd zero in, in particular, on education.",0.0
I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system.,0.0
I'm a product of public schools.,0.0
"And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act.",0.0
It was the first piece of legislation we introduced.,0.0
We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis.,0.0
We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort.,0.0
And it does several things.,0.0
It establishes high standards.,0.0
"It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing.",0.0
And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools.,0.0
It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education.,0.0
"It's also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what we've done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education.",0.0
It's working.,0.0
We've seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students.,0.0
We're making significant progress.,0.0
"Gwen, your question was about jobs?",0.0
I thought it was about jobs and poverty.,0.0
"I hope we get a chance to talk about education, but that's what the vice president talked about.",0.0
"Here's what's happened: In the time that they have been in office, in the last four years, 1.6 million private sector jobs have been lost, 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost.",1.0
And it's had real consequences in places like Cleveland.,1.0
"Cleveland is a wonderful, distinguished city that's done a lot of great things, but it has the highest poverty rate in the country.",0.0
One out of almost two children in Cleveland are now living in poverty.,1.0
"During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty.",1.0
"And what the most striking and startling thing is, they are the first presidency in 70 years -- and I'm talking Democrats, Republican, presidents who led us through World War, through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Cold War -- every one of them created jobs until this president.",0.0
We have to do better.,0.0
We have a plan.,0.0
"We're going to get rid of -- by the way, they're for outsourcing jobs.",0.0
"I want to make sure people hear that, the fundamental difference with us.",0.0
The administration says over and over that the outsourcing of millions of American jobs is good.,0.0
We're against it.,0.0
We want to get rid of tax cuts for companies sending jobs overseas.,0.0
"We want to balance this budget, get back to fiscal responsibility.",0.0
"And we want to invest in the creative, innovative jobs of the future.",0.0
"Gwen, we've got 111 million American taxpayers that have benefited from our income tax cuts.",0.0
We've got 33 million students who've benefited from No Child Left Behind.,0.0
We've got 40 million seniors who benefited from the reform of the Medicare system.,0.0
The Democrats promised prescription drug benefits.,0.0
For years they've run on that platform.,0.0
They never got it done.,0.0
The president got it done.,0.0
"We also dropped 5 million people totally off the federal income tax rolls, so they no longer have to pay any federal income tax at all.",0.0
"So the story, I think, is a good one.",0.0
And the data he's using is old data.,0.0
It's from 2003.,0.0
It doesn't include any of the gains that we've made in the last years.,0.0
We've added 1.7 million jobs to the economy.,0.0
The vice president and president like to talk about their experience on the campaign trail.,0.0
Millions of people have lost their jobs.,0.0
Millions have fallen into poverty.,0.0
"Family incomes are down, while the cost of everything is going up.",0.0
We have this mess in Iraq.,0.0
"Mr. Vice President, I don't think the country can take four more years of this kind of experience.",0.0
Because we will do what they've not done.,0.0
"You know, if you look at what's happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit.",1.0
They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security.,0.0
Not done.,0.0
"Not only that, it's the biggest fiscal turnaround in American history.",0.0
And there's no end in sight.,0.0
"The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they're going to do about it.",0.0
John Kerry and I believe we have a moral responsibility not to leave trillions of debt to our children and our grandchildren.,0.0
"So here's what we're going to do, to answer your question.",0.0
"And I want everyone to hear this, because there have been exaggerations made on the campaign trail: Roll back tax cuts for people who make over $200,000 a year; we will do that.",0.0
"We want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year and give additional tax cuts to those middle-class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care.",0.0
"These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief.",0.0
"But to help get us back on the path to a balanced budget, we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucratic spending in Washington.",0.0
"One of the amazing things that's happened is they've actually layered on more supervisory people, people at the supervisory level, in this government.",0.0
We also want to close some corporate loopholes.,0.0
"Now, I want to be honest with people.",0.0
We can't eliminate this deficit.,0.0
People have heard that over and over and over in four years.,0.0
We cannot do it.,0.0
We're in too deep a hole.,0.0
But we can cut the deficit in half.,0.0
"Gwen, the Kerry record on taxes is one basically of voting for a large number of tax increases -- 98 times in the United States Senate.",0.0
"There's a fundamental philosophical difference here between the president and myself, who believe that we ought to let the American people keep more of what they earn and we ought to empower them to have more control over their own lives -- I think the Kerry-Edwards approach basically is to raise taxes and to give government more control over the lives of individual citizens.",0.0
We think that's the wrong way to go.,0.0
There's a fundamental difference of opinion here.,0.0
They talk about the top bracket and going after only those people in the top bracket.,0.0
"Well, the fact of the matter is a great many of our small businesses pay taxes under the personal income taxes rather than the corporate rate.",0.0
"And about 900,000 small businesses will be hit if you do, in fact, do what they want to do with the top bracket.",0.0
That's not smart because seven out of 10 new jobs in America are created by small businesses.,0.0
You do not want to tax them.,0.0
It's a bad idea to increase the burden on those folks.,0.0
"The senator himself said, during the course of the primaries, that the Kerry plan would drive us deeper into deficit.",0.0
Those were the senator's words about his running-mate.,0.0
"The fact of the matter is, the president and I will go forward to make the tax cuts permanent.",0.0
That's good policy.,0.0
That's what we ought to do.,0.0
"But with fiscal restraint, we'll also drive the deficit down 50 percent in the course of the next five years.",0.0
We are committed to cutting back anything in our programs that need to be cut back to get us back on a path to fiscal responsibility.,0.0
"John Kerry, Mr. Vice President, has voted or co-sponsored over 600 times tax cuts for the American people -- over 600 times.",0.0
And there is a philosophical difference between us and them.,0.0
"We are for more tax cuts for the middle class than they're for, have been for the last four years.",0.0
But we are not for more tax cuts for multimillionaires.,0.0
They are.,0.0
And it is a fundamental difference in what we think needs to be done in this country.,0.0
"Yesterday, the president signed an extension of middle- class tax cuts, the 10 percent bracket, the marriage penalty relief and the increase in the child tax credit.",0.0
Senators Kerry and Edwards weren't even there to vote for it when it came to final passage.,0.0
"My concern is specifically with what's happened to our medical care system because of rising malpractice insurance rates, because we failed to adequately reform our medical liability structure.",0.0
And they were deeply concerned because they were fearful that there'd be another increase in malpractice insurance rates as a result of what they believe are frivolous lawsuits and that that would put them out of business.,0.0
And one doctor indicated that her rates have gone up so much that she's now to the point where she is screening patients.,0.0
"She won't take high-risk patients anymore because of the danger that that will generate a lawsuit, and a lawsuit will put her out of business.",0.0
This has had a devastating impact in a lot of communities.,0.0
"My home state of Wyoming, we've lost the top insurer of malpractice insurance in the state.",0.0
"The rates for a general practitioner have gone from $40,000 a year to $100,000 a year for an insurance policy.",0.0
We think this has a devastating impact on the quality of health care.,0.0
"As I say, high risk patients don't get covered anymore.",0.0
We've lost one out of eleven OB/GYN practitioners in the country.,0.0
"We think it can be fixed, needs to be fixed.",0.0
"Now, specifically, what we need to do is cap non-economic damages, and we also think you need to limit the awards that the trial attorneys take out of all of this.",0.0
Over 50 percent of the settlements go to the attorneys and for administrating overhead.,0.0
We passed medical liability reform through the House of Representatives.,0.0
It's been blocked in the Senate.,0.0
"Senator Kerry's voted 10 times against medical liability reform, and I don't believe Senator Edwards supports it, either, not the kind that would be meaningful.",0.0
"Well let me say, first of all, I'm proud of the work I did on behalf of kids and families against big insurance companies, big drug companies and big HMOs.",0.0
We do have too many lawsuits.,0.0
And the reality is there's something that we can do about it.,0.0
John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it.,0.0
"We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed; hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don't do it; have a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases.",0.0
That way we keep the cases out of the system that don't belong in the system.,0.0
They talk about frivolous cases.,1.0
We believe cases that don't belong in the system should never be in the system.,0.0
"But we don't believe that we should take away the right of people like Valerie Lakey, who was the young girl who I represented, five years old, severely injured for life, on a defective swimming pool drain cover.",0.0
It turns out the company knew of 12 other children who had either been killed or severely injured by the same problem.,0.0
They hid it.,0.0
They didn't tell anybody.,0.0
They could have fixed it with a 2-cent screw.,0.0
That's wrong.,0.0
"John Kerry and I are always going to stand with the Valerie Lakeys of the world, and not with the insurance companies.",0.0
Am I personally attacked?,0.0
"I think the truth is that what they're doing is talking about an issue that really doesn't have a great deal to do with what's happening with medical cost in this country, which I think is a very serious issue.",0.0
"And I would be the first to say that what the vice president described a few minutes ago, problems with malpractice premiums, that's true, it's real.",0.0
It's very real.,0.0
What doctors talk about is very serious.,0.0
And they're getting squeezed from both sides.,0.0
"I mean, because, they have trouble getting reimbursed, first of all, for the care that they provide, you know, from the government or from health-care companies.",0.0
"And, on the flip side, their malpractice costs are going up.",0.0
"That's very real, which is why we have proposed a plan to keep cases out of the system that don't belong there.",0.0
But it's very important to put this in context.,0.0
"Because, in context, everything they're proposing, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office, amounts to about half of 1 percent of health-care costs in this country -- half of 1 percent.",0.0
We have double-digit inflation in health care costs.,0.0
"We've seen the largest rise in medical costs in the last four years in the country's history: $3,500 nationally.",0.0
And nobody who's watching this debate needs me to explain this to them.,0.0
They know it.,0.0
"Again, largest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of Medicare.",0.0
"We think we have a plan to keep cases that don't belong in the system out, but we also do what they haven't done.",0.0
Five million Americans have lost their health care coverage.,0.0
Medical costs are skyrocketing.,0.0
"We have a serious health care plan to bring down costs for everybody, to cover millions more Americans and to actually stand up to drug companies and insurance companies which this administration has been unwilling to do.",0.0
"Gwen, we think lawsuit abuse is a serious problem in this country.",0.0
We think we badly need tort reform.,0.0
"I was in Minnesota the other day, where I visited an aircraft manufacturing plant.",0.0
It's a great success story.,0.0
This is a company that started 20 years ago with nothing.,0.0
Today they're the second- leading producer of piston-driven aircraft in the country.,0.0
"He told me that if it weren't for the increased cost of his liability insurance, in this case product liability, he could hire 200 more people in his factory.",0.0
We've built into the system enormous costs as a result of our practice with respect to litigation.,0.0
We have to find ways to get a handle on it.,0.0
"He mentioned Medicare up 17 percent, somehow that that was something we caused.",0.0
The 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums was the direct result of a statute adopted in 1997.,0.0
John Kerry voted for it.,0.0
"It establishes the formula for Part B of Medicare that says, in effect, it has to cover 25 percent of the cost of the program.",0.0
And the reason the money had to go into the trust fund was to make certain that we could cover those eligible for benefits.,0.0
"While you were in private practice in law and as a senator, you had the advantage of a special tax loophole, Subchapter S corporation, which you set up so you could avoid paying $600,000 in Medicare taxes that would have gone into the fund.",0.0
"And it's those kinds of loopholes that necessitate a premium increase under the law that was enacted in 1997, supported by John Kerry.",0.0
"Well, first of all, I have paid all the taxes that I owe.",0.0
"When the vice president was CEO of Halliburton, they took advantage of every offshore loophole available.",1.0
They had multiple offshore companies that were avoiding taxes.,0.0
Those are the kind of things that ought to be closed.,0.0
They ought to be closed.,0.0
They ought to be closed for anybody.,0.0
"They ought to be closed whether they're personal, and they ought to be closed whether they apply to a corporation.",0.0
"But the reality is health care costs are going up every day for the American people, and I hope we're going to get a chance to talk more about health care.",0.0
We've done a lot to reduce the cost of health care.,0.0
"The Medicare drug benefit that we'll be providing to seniors beginning in '06 will provide upwards to $1,300 a year to help them buy prescription drugs.",0.0
The drug savings -- drug discount card that's now available saves an estimated 15 percent to 30 percent off the cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens.,0.0
So we're moving in as many areas as we can to make certain we hold down and reduce the health care costs.,0.0
"Well, first of all, let me say that John Kerry has -- I can use his name now?",0.0
"OK. John Kerry has been, as have I, been completely consistent about Iraq.",0.0
We've made very clear from the beginning -- and not an afterthought; we said it at the time -- that we had to confront Saddam Hussein and that we had to have a coalition and a plan to be successful.,0.0
"And the vice president didn't say much about it in your earlier question, but Paul Bremer has now made clear that they didn't have enough troops and they didn't have a plan.",1.0
"And the American people are seeing the results of that every single day, in spite of the proud and courageous service of our men and women in uniform.",0.0
"Now, flip-flops: They should know something about flip-flops.",0.0
They've seen a lot of it during their administration.,0.0
They were first against the 9/11 Commission; then they were for it.,0.0
"They were for a department of homeland security -- I mean, they were against the Department of Homeland Security; then they were for it.",0.0
They said they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus when they came into office aside to protect Social Security; then they changed their minds.,0.0
"They said that they supported the troops; and then while our troops were on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, they went to the Congress and lobbied to have their combat pay cut.",0.0
They said that they were going to do something about health care in this country.,0.0
And they've done something: They've made it worse.,0.0
They said that they were going to fund their No Child Left Behind; $27 billion short today.,0.0
"Over and over, this administration has said one thing and done another.",0.0
This president said -- I listened to him the other night at his 2000 debate saying: I'm for a national patients' bill of rights.,0.0
I know something about this.,0.0
"John McCain and Senator Kennedy and I wrote it, got it passed in the Senate.",0.0
"We don't have a patients' bill of rights because of one man today, the president of the United States.",0.0
They've gone back and forth.,0.0
"Well, Gwen, I can think of a lot of words to describe Senator Kerry's position on Iraq; ""consistent"" is not one of them.",0.0
"I think if you look at the record from voting for sending the troops then voting against the resources they needed when they got there, then saying I actually voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it, saying in response to a question knowing everything I know now, yes, I would have cast exactly the same vote and then shortly after that saying wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, consistency doesn't come to mind as I consider that record.",0.0
The question of troops is an interesting and important one.,0.0
We have looked to our commanders on the ground in Iraq for guidance on what they think they need.,0.0
"If they need more troops, they'll ask us.",0.0
But the key here is not to try to solve the problems in Iraq by putting in more American troops.,0.0
The key is to get the Iraqis to take on the responsibility for their own security.,0.0
That's exactly what we're doing.,0.0
"If you put American troops in there in larger number and don't get the Iraqis into the fight, you'll postpone the day when you can in fact bring our boys home.",1.0
It's vital that we deal with any need for additional troops by putting Iraqis into the effort.,0.0
Forty-nine percent increase in funding for elementary and secondary education under No Child Left Behind; that's a lot of money even by Massachusetts' standards.,0.0
"Yes, but they didn't fund the mandates that they put on the schools all over this country.",0.0
"That's the reason 800 teachers -- one of the reasons -- 800 teachers have been laid off, right here in Cleveland.",0.0
One-third of our public schools are failing under this administration.,0.0
Half of African-Americans are dropping out of high school.,0.0
Half of Hispanic-American are dropping out of high school.,0.0
John and I have -- and I don't have the time now -- but we have a clear plan to improve our public schools that starts with getting our best teachers into the schools where we need them the most by creating incentives for them to go there.,0.0
"Gwen, No Child Left Behind, they were for it; now they're against it.",0.0
They voted for it; now they're opposed to it.,0.0
We are making significant progress there.,0.0
We are closing the achievement gap.,0.0
"The results coming in from a number of studies show, without question, that on math and reading, that in fact our minority students, our Hispanic and African-American students are doing better, and that gap between them and the majority population is, in fact, closing.",0.0
So we are doing exactly the right thing.,0.0
"They're the ones who have been for the Patriot Act and against it, for No Child Left Behind and then against it.",0.0
"We are for accountability, and we are for high standards.",0.0
John and I voted for No Child Left Behind because we thought that accountability and standards were the right thing to do.,0.0
But they make -- did you figure out you were wrong?,0.0
"Well, in fairness, if you feel like you need to go to him, we'll -- I'll stop.",0.0
"Well, I must say it's one of the disappointments of the last four years, is that we've not been able to do what the president did in Texas, for example, when he was able to reach across the aisle and bring Democrats along on major issues of the day.",0.0
"We had some success early on, I think, in No Child Left Behind, when we, in fact, had broad, bipartisan support.",0.0
"We had a lot of support for the Patriot Act, when we passed that on a bipartisan basis.",0.0
Now we're seeing objection to that by the other side.,0.0
All I know is to continue to try to work it.,0.0
"It's a disappointment, in a sense, that I remember from my earlier service when things worked much differently, when, in fact, some of my best friends in the Congress were people I worked with, like Tom Foley, who was a majority leader and later speaker of the House.",0.0
"One of my strongest allies in Congress when I was secretary of defense was Jack Murtha, a Democrat who is chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.",0.0
We used to be able to do more together on a bipartisan basis than seems possible these days.,0.0
I'm not sure exactly why.,0.0
"I think, in part, it may be the change in the majority-minority status in the Senate has been difficult for both sides to adjust to.",0.0
"And the Senate, of course, has been very evenly divided, 50-50, then 51-49, then 49-51 the other way.",0.0
We'll keep working at it.,0.0
I think it's important for us to try.,0.0
I believe that it is essential for us to do everything we can to garner as much support from the other side of the aisle as possible.,0.0
We've had support -- we had our keynote address at our convention was delivered by Zell Miller.,0.0
So there are some Democrats who agree with our approach.,0.0
"And hopefully in a second term, we'll see an improvement along those lines.",0.0
"The president said that he would unite this country, that he was a uniter, not a divider.",0.0
Have you ever seen America more divided?,1.0
Have you ever seen Washington more divided?,1.0
The reality is it is not an accident.,1.0
It's the direct result of the choices they've made and their efforts that have created division in America.,0.0
We can do better than that in this country.,0.0
"Now I want to go back to the whole issue of health care, because we touched it, but I think the American people deserve to know what we would do different.",0.0
"I mean, 5 million people losing their health care -- everyone who's watching this knows health insurance premiums are through the roof.",0.0
We need to talk about what we will do that they haven't done.,0.0
"First, we're going to make the same health care that's available to members of Congress available to all Americans.",0.0
We're going to cover all kids.,0.0
"Not only that, we're going to bring down costs by pooling the catastrophic costs so we bring down premiums.",0.0
"And we're going to give tax breaks directly to families, save them up to $1,000 a year, and to businesses -- the vice president talked about that a few minutes ago -- so that they can provide health care to their employees.",0.0
And we're also going to finally do something about the cost of prescription drugs.,0.0
They've blocked allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada.,0.0
We're going to allow it.,0.0
They would not allow the government to use its negotiating power to get discounts for seniors.,0.0
We're also going to stand up to the drug companies and do something about these drug company ads on television which are out of control.,0.0
"The fact of the matter is, the most important and significant change in health care in the last several years was the Medicare reform bill this year.",0.0
It's the most sweeping change in 40 years.,0.0
Medicare used to pay for heart bypass surgery but didn't pay for the prescription drugs that might allow you to avoid it.,0.0
"The fact is that when that came up, Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards voted against it.",0.0
It'll provide prescription drug benefits to 40 million senior citizens.,0.0
"It's a very, very significant piece of legislation.",0.0
"They had a choice on allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada, of being with the American people or with the drug companies.",0.0
They were with the drug companies.,1.0
They had a choice on negotiating discounts in the Medicare prescription drug bill of being with the American people or with the drug companies.,0.0
"They had a choice on the patients' bill of rights, allowing people to make their own health care decisions and not having insurance companies make them, be with the American people, be with the big insurance companies.",0.0
They're with the insurance companies.,1.0
John Kerry and I will always fight for the American people.,1.0
"Yes, I certainly do.",0.0
"(LAUGHTER)  But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating.",0.0
I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening.,0.0
"Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.",0.0
"Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.",0.0
And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other.,0.0
"Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.",0.0
I support it.,0.0
"I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.",0.0
The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things.,0.0
"No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it.",0.0
I support the goals.,0.0
But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.,0.0
"Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.",0.0
"You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.",0.0
So I complain about that.,0.0
I've argued that we should fully funded it.,0.0
The president says I've changed my mind.,0.0
I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.,0.0
So these are the differences.,0.0
"Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.",0.0
The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.,0.0
I have a plan to put people back to work.,0.0
That's not wishy- washy.,1.0
I'm going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas.,0.0
The president wants to keep them open.,0.0
I think I'm right.,0.0
I think he's wrong.,0.0
I'm going to give you a tax cut.,0.0
"The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.",0.0
I think that's wrong.,0.0
"That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.",1.0
"Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.",0.0
"And, Senator, thank you.",0.0
"I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well.",0.0
"I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.",0.0
"He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.",0.0
And that sends a confusing signal to people.,0.0
"He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.",1.0
"No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does.",0.0
"You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.",0.0
"He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.",0.0
"I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.",0.0
He just brought up the tax cut.,0.0
"You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans.",0.0
That's right at the middle class.,0.0
He voted against it.,0.0
And yet he tells you he's for a middle- class tax cut.,0.0
It's -- you've got to be consistent when you're the president.,0.0
There's a lot of pressures.,0.0
And you've got to be firm and consistent.,0.0
"Each situation is different, Robin.",0.0
And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force.,0.0
The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.,0.0
"After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.",0.0
"After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.",0.0
"In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.",0.0
But 9/11 changed it all.,0.0
I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people.,0.0
That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.,0.0
"That's why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist.",0.0
"And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan.",0.0
"And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.",0.0
"And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction.",0.0
"And that was the serious, serious threat.",1.0
"So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.",0.0
"But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.",0.0
He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs.,0.0
"We all thought there was weapons there, Robin.",0.0
My opponent thought there was weapons there.,0.0
That's why he called him a grave threat.,0.0
"I wasn't happy when we found out there wasn't weapons, and we've got an intelligence group together to figure out why.",0.0
But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat.,0.0
And the world is better off without him in power.,0.0
"And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.",0.0
"Thank you, sir.",0.0
"Robin, I'm going to answer your question.",0.0
"I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time.",0.0
The world is more dangerous today.,0.0
The world is more dangerous today because the president didn't make the right judgments.,0.0
"Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.",0.0
He wants you to believe that because he can't come here and tell you that he's created new jobs for America.,0.0
He's lost jobs.,0.0
"He can't come here and tell you that he's created health care for Americans because, what, we've got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri.",0.0
He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.,0.0
So what does he do?,0.0
He's trying to attack me.,0.0
He wants you to believe that I can't be president.,0.0
And he's trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind.,0.0
"Well, let me tell you straight up: I've never changed my mind about Iraq.",0.0
I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat.,0.0
I always believed he was a threat.,0.0
Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.,0.0
I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary.,0.0
"But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.",0.0
I would have brought our allies to our side.,0.0
I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.,0.0
"This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside.",0.0
"And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons.",0.0
"He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden.",0.0
You remember the last debate?,0.0
My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we used force to protect ourselves.,0.0
That's the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working.,0.0
"That's the kind of mindset that said, ""Let's keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well.""",0.0
Saddam Hussein was a threat because he could have given weapons of mass destruction to terrorist enemies.,0.0
Sanctions were not working.,0.0
The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein.,0.0
"The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction.",0.0
"And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.",0.0
"He didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President.",0.0
That was the objective.,0.0
"And if we'd used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq.",0.0
"And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.",0.0
That's the war against terror.,0.0
"Anthony, I would not.",0.0
"I have laid out a different plan, because the president's plan is not working.",0.0
You see that every night on television.,0.0
There's chaos in Iraq.,0.0
King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you can't hold elections in Iraq with the chaos that's going on today.,0.0
"Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.",0.0
Those are the Republican chairman's words.,0.0
"Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it's in the zone of dangerous.",0.0
"Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.",0.0
"Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different.",0.0
I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn't.,0.0
"He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U. N., pushed them away individually.",0.0
"Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO.",0.0
They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq.,0.0
Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq?,0.0
No.,0.0
Were they silent?,0.0
Yes.,0.0
Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that?,0.0
"No, because they've always wanted this to be an American effort.",0.0
"You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition.""",0.0
"Now, that's not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer.",0.0
I'm going to get the training done for our troops.,0.0
I'm going to get the training of Iraqis done faster.,0.0
And I'm going to get our allies back to the table.,0.0
"Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the finance minister from Iraq.",0.0
He came to see me.,0.0
And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections.,0.0
Think about it: They're going from tyranny to elections.,1.0
He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold.,0.0
He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free.,0.0
"He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic.",0.0
And we need to stand with him.,0.0
"My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.",0.0
"We're going to train troops, and we are.",0.0
"We'll have 125,000 trained by the end of December.",0.0
We're spending about $7 billion.,0.0
He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.,0.0
And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit?,0.0
Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.,1.0
Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.,0.0
Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn't believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake.,0.0
I know how these people think.,0.0
I meet with them all the time.,0.0
I talk to Tony Blair all the time.,0.0
Our plan is working.,0.0
"Yes, sir, please.",0.0
"Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan.",0.0
That was the right place.,0.0
"And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.",0.0
"Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction.",0.0
"That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime.",0.0
Now we have to succeed.,0.0
I've always said that.,0.0
I have been consistent.,0.0
"Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.",0.0
"First of all, we didn't find out he didn't have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons.",0.0
"And secondly, it's a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden.",0.0
The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.,0.0
That's what the war on terror is about.,0.0
"Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.",0.0
But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.,0.0
Thank you.,0.0
"No, I appreciate that.",0.0
"I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country.",0.0
And I recognize I've made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country.,0.0
I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.,0.0
Somebody called that stubborn.,1.0
"He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict.",0.0
I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.,0.0
But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security.,0.0
"You know, I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular.",0.0
"I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.",0.0
And people in Europe didn't like that decision.,0.0
"And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do.",0.0
"I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership that's committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism.",0.0
"I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to -- brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge.",0.0
I don't think we ought to join that.,0.0
That was unpopular.,0.0
"And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.",0.0
We'll continue to reach out.,0.0
"Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.",0.0
People love America.,0.0
"Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.",0.0
You don't want to join the International Criminal Court just because it's popular in certain capitals in Europe.,0.0
"Nikki, that's a question that's been raised by a lot of people around the country.",0.0
"Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.",0.0
"The president stood right here in this hall four years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you, ""Under what circumstances would you send people to war? """,0.0
"And his answer was, ""With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done.""",0.0
He didn't do that.,0.0
He broke that promise.,0.0
We didn't have enough forces.,0.0
"General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.",0.0
They retired General Shinseki for telling him that.,0.0
This president hasn't listened.,0.0
I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted.,0.0
I went to New York.,0.0
I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable.,0.0
"I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they'd be there with us.",0.0
"But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, ""Nope.",0.0
"Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.",0.0
"We're going.""",0.0
He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.,0.0
"Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us.",0.0
He didn't.,0.0
He broke his word.,0.0
"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?",0.0
"Do you have what it takes? """,0.0
"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level? """,0.0
"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr.",0.0
"Of course, I listen to our generals.",0.0
That's what a president does.,0.0
A president sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy.,0.0
"You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component.",0.0
"General Shinseki had the wisdom to say, ""You're going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace.""",0.0
The military's job is to win the war.,0.0
A president's job is to win the peace.,0.0
The president did not do what was necessary.,0.0
Didn't bring in enough nation.,0.0
Didn't deliver the help.,0.0
Didn't close off the borders.,0.0
Didn't even guard the ammo dumps.,0.0
And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump.,1.0
"But you're absolutely correct, it is a threat, it's a huge threat.",1.0
"And what's interesting is, it's a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn't a threat.",0.0
"If he'd let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn't have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden.",0.0
"Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.",0.0
"For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor.",1.0
We were safer before President Bush came to office.,1.0
Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.,1.0
So what do we do?,0.0
"We've got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who've been involved, in their initiative.",0.0
We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.,0.0
"But the president's been slow to do that, even in Russia.",0.0
"At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.",0.0
I've proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years.,0.0
And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon.,0.0
It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.,0.0
I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.,0.0
"And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.",0.0
That answer almost made me want to scowl.,0.0
"He keeps talking about, ""Let the inspectors do their job.""",0.0
It's naive and dangerous to say that.,0.0
That's what the Duelfer report showed.,0.0
He was deceiving the inspectors.,0.0
"Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.",0.0
I fully understand the threat.,0.0
"And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.",0.0
We've been doing that.,0.0
Let me talk about North Korea.,0.0
"It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea.",0.0
"Remember, he's the person who's accusing me of not acting multilaterally.",0.0
"He now wants to take the six-party talks we have -- China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States -- and undermine them by having bilateral talks.",0.0
That's what President Clinton did.,0.0
And guess what happened?,0.0
He didn't honor the agreement.,0.0
He was enriching uranium.,0.0
That is a bad policy.,0.0
"Of course, we're paying attention to these.",0.0
It's a great question about Iran.,0.0
"That's why in my speech to the Congress I said: There's an ""Axis of Evil,"" Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we're paying attention to it.",0.0
"Thank you very much, Ann.",0.0
"I've asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can't go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you.",0.0
"This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.",0.0
We've been told that.,0.0
The when I can't tell you.,0.0
"Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years.",0.0
These people wait.,0.0
They'll plan.,0.0
They plot.,0.0
I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are.,0.0
"I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.",0.0
You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.,0.0
"And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they're plotting, you've got to have the best cooperation you've ever had in the world.",0.0
"Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.",0.0
We've got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now.,0.0
I'm going to change that.,0.0
And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.,0.0
"Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.",0.0
"When you get on an airplane, your bag is X- rayed, but the cargo hold isn't X-rayed.",0.0
Do you feel safer?,0.0
"This president in the last debate said, ""Well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that.""",0.0
"Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.",0.0
He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible.,0.0
"We have bridges and tunnels that aren't being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren't secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms.",0.0
"If we had a disaster today, could they handle it?",0.0
This president chose a tax cut over homeland security.,0.0
Wrong choice.,0.0
"That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.",0.0
"Listen, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.",0.0
"My opponent's right, we need good intelligence.",0.0
It's also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.,0.0
The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense.,0.0
"We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once.",0.0
And that's the reality.,0.0
And there's a lot of good people working hard.,0.0
We're doing the best we possibly can to share information.,0.0
That's why the Patriot Act was important.,0.0
"The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.",0.0
It's a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other.,0.0
My opponent says he hadn't changed his position on it.,0.0
"No, but he's for weakening it.",0.0
I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.,0.0
"First of all, I don't think he can succeed in Iraq.",0.0
I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.,0.0
I don't see how you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.,0.0
I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.,0.0
"This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.",1.0
"Well, the president and his experts have told America that it's not a question of if; it's a question of when.",0.0
And I accept what the president has said.,0.0
"These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill.",1.0
I understand that.,0.0
That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.,0.0
But you heard the president just say to you that we've added money.,0.0
"Folks, the test is not if you've added money; the test is that you've done everything possible to make America secure.",0.0
He chose a tax cut for wealthy Americans over the things that I listed to you.,0.0
"Well, we'll talk about the tax cut for middle class here in a minute.",0.0
"But yes, I'm worried.",1.0
I'm worried.,1.0
I'm worried about our country.,1.0
"And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.",0.0
And the reason I'm worried is because there's a vicious enemy that has an ideology of hate.,0.0
"And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom.",0.0
Liberty can change habits.,0.0
And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.,0.0
I haven't yet.,0.0
Just want to make sure they're safe.,0.0
"When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesn't kill you.",0.0
And that's why the FDA and that's why the surgeon general are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way.,0.0
I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.,0.0
"And what my worry is is that, you know, it looks like it's from Canada, and it might be from a third world.",0.0
And that's why we're doing what we're doing.,0.0
"Now, it may very well be here in December you'll hear me say, I think there's a safe way to do it.",0.0
There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.,0.0
"One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.",0.0
And we're doing just that.,0.0
"Another is to pass -- to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and they're working.",0.0
"Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs.",0.0
These cards make sense.,0.0
"And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.",0.0
Because I went to Washington to fix problems.,0.0
"Medicare -- the issue of Medicare used to be called ""Mediscare.""",0.0
People didn't want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically.,0.0
I wanted to get something done.,0.0
I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system.,0.0
"And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage.",0.0
Thank you for asking.,0.0
"John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it.",0.0
"Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people be able to import drugs from Canada?",0.0
You know what he said?,0.0
"""I think that makes sense.",0.0
"I think that's a good idea"" -- four years ago.",0.0
"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that.""",0.0
"Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.",0.0
"He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate.",0.0
"We sent it over to the House, that you could import drugs.",0.0
We took care of the safety issues.,0.0
We're not talking about third-world drugs.,0.0
The president blocked it.,0.0
"The president also took Medicare, which belongs to you.",0.0
You know what he did?,0.0
He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies right out of your pockets.,0.0
That's the difference between us.,0.0
"The president sides with the power companies, the oil companies, the drug companies.",0.0
"And I'm fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and I'm fighting to let Medicare survive.",0.0
I'm fighting for the middle class.,0.0
That is the difference.,0.0
"If they're safe, they're coming.",0.0
I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.,0.0
"President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you.",0.0
"Now, he talks about Medicare.",0.0
He's been in the United States Senate 20 years.,0.0
Show me one accomplishment toward Medicare that he accomplished.,0.0
"I've been in Washington, D. C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system.",0.0
That's what leadership is all about.,0.0
"Actually, Mr. President, in 1997 we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it.",0.0
"We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.",0.0
"And we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time.",0.0
And it's the president's fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history.,0.0
He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together.,0.0
Go figure.,0.0
Very easily.,0.0
John Edwards is the author of the Patients' Bill of Rights.,0.0
He wanted to give people rights.,0.0
John Edwards and I support tort reform.,0.0
"We both believe that, as lawyers -- I'm a lawyer, too.",0.0
It's in my health-care proposal.,0.0
Go to johnkerry.com.,0.0
And you'll find a tort reform plan.,0.0
"Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.",0.0
Is it a problem?,0.0
"Yes, it's a problem.",0.0
"Do we need to fix it, particularly for OGBYNs (sic) and for brain surgeons and others?",0.0
But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.,0.0
Your premiums are going up.,0.0
"You've gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500.",0.0
You've gone up 64 percent.,0.0
Everything's gone up.,0.0
Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president.,0.0
He's done nothing about it.,0.0
I have a plan.,0.0
I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you.,0.0
I have a plan to cover all children.,0.0
I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senators and congressmen give themselves.,0.0
I have a plan that's going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.,0.0
"And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive and makes health care more affordable.",1.0
"Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year.",0.0
That's all.,0.0
Let me see where to start here.,0.0
"First, the National Journal named Senator Kennedy the most liberal senator of all.",0.0
And that's saying something in that bunch.,0.0
You might say that took a lot of hard work.,0.0
"The reason I bring that up is because he's proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap.",0.0
He can't.,0.0
He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programs.,0.0
That's just reality.,0.0
And what are his health programs?,0.0
"First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.",0.0
There's a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he's so much for it.,0.0
"Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase.",0.0
That shows a lack of understanding.,0.0
Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.,1.0
"And finally, he said he's going to have a novel health care plan.",0.0
You know what it is?,0.0
The federal government is going to run it.,0.0
It's the largest increase in federal government health care ever.,0.0
And it fits with his philosophy.,0.0
That's why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal.,0.0
That's what liberals do.,0.0
They create government-sponsored health care.,0.0
Maybe you think that makes sense.,0.0
I don't.,0.0
Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.,0.0
It would ruin the quality of health care in America.,0.0
"Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.",0.0
"But look, what's really important, Charlie, is the president is just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around.",0.0
"I mean, ""compassionate conservative,"" what does that mean?",0.0
"Cutting 500,000 kids from after-school programs, cutting 365,000 kids from health care, running up the biggest deficits in American history.",0.0
"Mr. President, you're batting 0 for 2.",0.0
"I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything.",0.0
What means something is: Do you have a plan?,0.0
And I want to talk about my plan some more -- I hope we can.,0.0
"You're right, what does matter is a plan.",0.0
He said he's for -- you're now for capping punitive damages?,0.0
That's odd.,0.0
You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.,0.0
"Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem.",0.0
He's been in the United States Senate for 20 years and he hasn't addressed it.,0.0
We passed it out of the House of Representatives.,0.0
Guess where it's stuck?,0.0
"It's stuck in the Senate, because the trial lawyers won't act on it.",0.0
And he put a trial lawyer on the ticket.,0.0
"Right, thank you for that.",0.0
We have a deficit.,0.0
We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.,0.0
"You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped.",0.0
And that cost us revenue.,0.0
That cost us revenue.,0.0
"And I'm going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.",0.0
We've got to pay our troops more.,0.0
We have.,0.0
I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money.,0.0
"And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.",0.0
"Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession.",0.0
"Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added.",0.0
"We found out today that over the past 13 months, we've added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months.",0.0
"I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by five years.",0.0
"And you're right, I haven't vetoed any spending bills, because we work together.",0.0
"Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office.",0.0
"And today it's less than 1 percent, because we're working together to try to bring this deficit under control.",0.0
"Like you, I'm concerned about the deficit.",0.0
But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harm's way.,0.0
"And I'm not going to run up taxes, which will cost this economy jobs.",0.0
Thank you for your question.,0.0
Let me begin by saying that my health-care plan is not what the president described.,0.0
It is not a government takeover.,0.0
You have choice.,0.0
"Choose your doctor, choose your plan.",0.0
The government has nothing to do with it.,0.0
"In fact, it doesn't ask you to do anything -- if you don't want to take it, you don't have to.",0.0
"If you like your high premiums, you keep them.",0.0
That's the way we leave it.,0.0
"Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen.",0.0
That's where he was when he came into office.,0.0
We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit.,0.0
This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.,0.0
He's the first president in 72 years to lose jobs.,0.0
He talked about war.,0.0
This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when we're at war.,0.0
"Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.",0.0
They knew how to ask the American people for the right things.,0.0
"One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year.",0.0
"One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down.",0.0
The president thinks it's more important to fight for that top 1 percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you.,0.0
I want to put money in your pocket.,0.0
"I am -- I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000.",0.0
The only people affected by my plan are the top income earners of America.,0.0
"Well, look at the budget.",0.0
One is make sure Congress doesn't overspend.,0.0
But let me talk back about where we've been.,0.0
The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival.,0.0
"It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession.",0.0
"Because we cut taxes on everybody -- remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief -- the recession was one of the shortest in our nation's history.",0.0
"After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the president asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created.",0.0
"He lost 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen.",0.0
And most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country.,0.0
He came and asked for a tax cut -- we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear.,0.0
Do you know what he presented us with?,0.0
"A $25 billion giveaway to the biggest corporations in America, including a $254 million refund check to Enron.",0.0
Wrong priorities.,0.0
You are my priority.,0.0
Absolutely.,0.0
Right into the camera.,0.0
I am not going to raise taxes.,0.0
I have a tax cut.,0.0
And here's my tax cut.,0.0
"I raise the child-care credit by $1,000 for families to help them be able to take care of their kids.",0.0
"I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents -- and kids, if they're earning for themselves -- to be able to pay for college.",0.0
And I lower the cost of health care in the way that I described to you.,0.0
Every part of my program I've shown how I'm going to pay for it.,0.0
"And I've gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin, for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work.",0.0
"I've even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child-care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the president's deficit keeps growing and I've said as a pledge, ""I'm going to cut the deficit in half in four years.""",0.0
"Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.",0.0
We're going to do it like you do it.,0.0
The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule.,0.0
"Somebody here asked the question about, ""Why haven't you vetoed something? """,0.0
It's a good question.,0.0
"If you care about it, why don't you veto it?",0.0
"I think John McCain called the energy bill the ""No Lobbyist Left Behind"" bill.",0.0
"I mean, you've got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks.",0.0
"I'm pledging I will not raise taxes; I'm giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year.",0.0
"Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you're going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money.",0.0
"And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.",0.0
He's just not credible.,1.0
"If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps -- the spending caps -- over 200 times.",1.0
"And here he says he's going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden.",1.0
It's just not credible.,1.0
You cannot believe it.,1.0
And of course he's going to raise your taxes.,1.0
"You see, he's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending.",0.0
"He says, well, he's going to raise the taxes on the rich -- that's what he said -- the top two brackets.",0.0
"That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.",0.0
We've got battling green eye shades.,1.0
"Somewhere in between those numbers -- and so there's a difference, what he's promised and what he can raise.",0.0
"Now, either he's going to break all these wonderful promises he's told you about or he's going to raise taxes.",0.0
"And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.",0.0
Is my time up yet?,0.0
You looked at me like my clock was up.,0.0
"I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform.",0.0
"As I told you, we've just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we've created 1.9 million new jobs.",0.0
And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?,0.0
That's the fundamental question.,0.0
"Well, first of all, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion just aren't accurate.",0.0
Those are the fuzzy math figures put together by some group that works for the campaign.,0.0
That's not the number.,0.0
"Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes.",0.0
We've got $40 billion going to Bermuda.,0.0
We've got all kinds of giveaways.,0.0
We ought to be shutting those down.,0.0
"And third, credible: Ladies and gentlemen, in 1985, I was one of the first Democrats to move to balance the budget.",0.0
I voted for the balanced budget in '93 and '97.,0.0
We did it.,0.0
And I was there.,0.0
"Yes, I mean, he's got a record.",0.0
It's been there for 20 years.,0.0
"You can run, but you can't hide.",0.0
He voted 98 times to raise taxes.,0.0
"I mean, these aren't make-up figures.",0.0
And so people are going to have to look at the record.,0.0
Look at the record of the man running for the president.,0.0
They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings.,0.0
They named him because of his votes.,0.0
And it's reality.,0.0
It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.,0.0
Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.,0.0

I have -- was fought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the conservation reserve program to set aside millions of acres of land to help improve wildlife and the habitat.,0.0
We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with -- particularly in Western states -- to make sure that our forests were protected.,0.0
"What happens in those forests, because of lousy federal policy, is they grow to be -- they are not -- they're not harvested.",0.0
They're not taken care of.,0.0
"And as a result, they're like tinderboxes.",0.0
And over the last summers I've flown over there.,0.0
"And so, this is a reasonable policy to protect old stands of trees and at the same time make sure our forests aren't vulnerable to the forest fires that have destroyed acres after acres in the West.",0.0
"We've got a good, common-sense policy.",0.0
"Now, I'm going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment.",0.0
That's why I proposed a hydrogen automobile -- hydrogen-generated automobile.,0.0
We're spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that.,0.0
"That's why I'm a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way.",0.0
I guess you'd say I'm a good steward of the land.,0.0
The quality of the air's cleaner since I've been the president.,0.0
Fewer water complaints since I've been the president.,0.0
More land being restored since I've been the president.,0.0
"Boy, to listen to that -- the president, I don't think, is living in a world of reality with respect to the environment.",0.0
"Now, if you're a Red Sox fan, that's OK.",0.0
"But if you're a president, it's not.",0.0

Labels don't mean anything.,0.0

"Now, when it comes to the issue of the environment, this is one of the worst administrations in modern history.",0.0
"The Clear Skies bill that he just talked about, it's one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky, slap it onto something, like ""No Child Left Behind"" but you leave millions of children behind.",0.0
Here they're leaving the skies and the environment behind.,0.0
"If they just left the Clean Air Act all alone the way it is today, no change, the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the Clear Skies act.",0.0
We're going backwards.,0.0
"In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air-quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what they're doing to what they are calling the new source performance standards for air quality.",0.0
They're going backwards on the definition for wetlands.,0.0
They're going backwards on the water quality.,0.0
"They pulled out of the global warming, declared it dead, didn't even accept the science.",0.0
I'm going to be a president who believes in science.,0.0
"Well, had we joined the Kyoto treaty, which I guess he's referring to, it would have cost America a lot of jobs.",0.0
"It's one of these deals where, in order to be popular in the halls of Europe, you sign a treaty.",0.0
But I thought it would cost a lot -- I think there's a better way to do it.,0.0
"And I just told you the facts, sir.",0.0
The quality of the air is cleaner since I've been the president of the United States.,0.0
"And we'll continue to spend money on research and development, because I truly believe that's the way to get from how we live today to being able to live a standard of living that we're accustomed to and being able to protect our environment better, the use of technologies.",0.0
The fact is that the Kyoto treaty was flawed.,0.0
"I was in Kyoto, and I was part of that.",0.0
I know what happened.,0.0
But this president didn't try to fix it.,0.0
"He just declared it dead, ladies and gentlemen, and we walked away from the work of 160 nations over 10 years.",0.0
"You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don't like us in some parts of the world.",0.0
"You just say: Hey, we don't agree with you.",0.0
Goodbye.,0.0
The president's done nothing to try to fix it.,0.0
I will.,0.0
"Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive.",0.0
And unfortunately again I regret this administration has not seized them and embraced them.,0.0
Let me give you an example.,0.0
There is a tax loophole right now.,0.0
"If you're a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away.",0.0
"You get more money, you keep more of your taxes by going abroad.",0.0
"I'm going to shut that loophole, and I'm going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive.",0.0
"Secondly, we're going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America.",0.0
"Third, what's really hurting American business more than anything else is the cost of health care.",0.0
"Now, you didn't hear any plan from the president, because he doesn't have a plan to lower the cost of health care.",0.0
"Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush.",1.0
I have a plan to cover those folks.,0.0
I think you ought to get the break.,0.0
I want to lower your cost to health care.,0.0
"I want to fully fund education, No Child Left Behind, special-needs education.",0.0
"And that's how we're going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college.",0.0
China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are.,0.0
We've got to create the products of the future.,0.0
That's why I have a plan for energy independence within 10 years.,0.0
And we're going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work.,0.0
"And we're going to get the great entrepreneurial spirit of this country, and we're going to free ourselves from this dependency on Mideast oil.",0.0
That's how you create jobs and become competitive.,0.0
"Let me start with how to control the cost of health care: medical liability reform, for starters, which he's opposed.",0.0
"Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do.",0.0
"Thirdly, spread what's called health savings accounts.",0.0
"It's good for small businesses, good for owners.",0.0
You own your own account.,0.0
You can save tax-free.,0.0
You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it.,1.0
"This is different from saying, ""OK, let me incent you to go on the government.""",0.0
He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.,1.0
You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep -- stop outsourcing.,1.0
Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it won't work.,0.0
"The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan.",0.0
"I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal -- to use coal and gas.",0.0
It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.,0.0
It's stuck in the Senate.,0.0
He and his running-mate didn't show up to vote when they could have got it going in the Senate.,0.0
Less regulations if we want jobs here; legal reform if we want jobs here; and we've got to keep taxes low.,0.0
"Now, he says he's only going to tax the rich.",0.0
"Do you realize, 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level.",0.0
"And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here.",0.0
"You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.",0.0
I've never promised that.,0.0
"I'm not going to, because that would be pandering.",1.0
You can't.,0.0
"But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and that's what I'm talking about.",0.0
But let me just address what the president just said.,0.0
"Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.",1.0
The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan.,1.0
And you know why he gets that count?,1.0
"The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and he's counted as a small business.",1.0
Dick Cheney's counted as a small business.,1.0
That's how they do things.,1.0
That's just not right.,0.0
I own a timber company?,0.0
(LAUGHTER)  That's news to me.,0.0
(LAUGHTER)  Need some wood?,0.0
(LAUGHTER)  Most small businesses are Subchapter S corps.,0.0
They just are.,0.0
"I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio.",0.0
He's creating jobs.,0.0
Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.,0.0
Taxes are going up when you run up the top two brackets.,0.0
It's a fact.,0.0
I appreciate that.,0.0
I really don't think your rights are being watered down.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, I wouldn't support it if I thought that.",0.0
"Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that we've been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals.",1.0
So I really don't think so.,0.0
I hope you don't think that.,0.0
"I mean, I -- because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America.",0.0
"The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other.",0.0
The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn't share intelligence under the old law.,0.0
And that didn't make any sense.,0.0
Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again.,0.0
That's the task of the 21st century.,0.0
"And so, I don't think the Patriot Act abridges your rights at all.",0.0
And I know it's necessary.,0.0
I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.,0.0
"And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the Patriot Act.",0.0
"Former Governor Racicot, as chairman of the Republican Party, said he thought that the Patriot Act has to be changed and fixed.",0.0
"In fact, the inspector general of the Justice Department found that John Ashcroft had twice applied it in ways that were inappropriate.",0.0
People's rights have been abused.,0.0
"I met a man who spent eight months in prison, wasn't even allowed to call his lawyer, wasn't allowed to get -- finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out.",0.0
"This is in our country, folks, the United States of America.",0.0
They've got sneak-and-peek searches that are allowed.,0.0
They've got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise.,0.0
"Now, I voted for the Patriot Act.",0.0
Ninety-nine United States senators voted for it.,0.0
"And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.",1.0
Now that's not a flip-flop.,0.0
I believe in the Patriot Act.,0.0
We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA.,0.0
We need to be stronger on terrorism.,0.0
But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.,0.0
I'm not telling.,0.0
"Plus, I want them all voting for me.",0.0
(LAUGHTER)  I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law.,0.0
I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States.,0.0
"Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.",0.0
"I wouldn't pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldn't be said in a school because it had the words ""under God"" in it.",0.0
I think that's an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution.,0.0
"Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights.",0.0
That's a personal opinion.,0.0
That's not what the Constitution says.,0.0
"The Constitution of the United States says we're all -- you know, it doesn't say that.",0.0
It doesn't speak to the equality of America.,0.0
"And so, I would pick people that would be strict constructionists.",0.0
And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year -- the next four years.,0.0
And that's the kind of judge I'm going to put on there.,0.0
No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.,0.0
"Thank you, Charlie.",0.0
"A few years ago when he came to office, the president said -- these are his words -- ""What we need are some good conservative judges on the courts.""",0.0
And he said also that his two favorite justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas.,0.0
So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.,0.0
"Now, here's what I believe.",0.0
"I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.",0.0
I don't believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.,0.0
I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard.,0.0
He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.,0.0
"And he said the mark of a good judge, good justice, is that when you're reading their decision, their opinion, you can't tell if it's written by a man or woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian.",0.0
You just know you're reading a good judicial decision.,0.0
"What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it -- and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen.",0.0
"The future of things that matter to you -- in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department you'll have, whether we'll enforce the law.",1.0
Will we have equal opportunity?,1.0
Will women's rights be protected?,1.0
"Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?",1.0
Will a woman's right to choose be protected?,1.0
"These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.",0.0
I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.,0.0
"First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.",0.0
"I'm a Catholic, raised a Catholic.",0.0
I was an altar boy.,0.0
Religion has been a huge part of my life.,0.0
"But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever.",1.0
I can't do that.,1.0
But I can counsel people.,0.0
I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility.,0.0
"I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.",0.0
"But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation.",0.0
And I have to make that judgment.,0.0
"Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.",0.0
"And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don't deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can't afford it otherwise.",0.0
That's why I think it's important.,0.0
"That's why I think it's important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.",0.0
You'll help prevent AIDS.,0.0
"You'll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.",0.0
"You'll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question.",0.0
I'm trying to decipher that.,0.0
"My answer is, we're not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion.",0.0
"This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.",0.0
It's a brutal practice.,1.0
It's one way to help reduce abortions.,0.0
My opponent voted against the ban.,0.0
I think there ought to be parental notification laws.,0.0
He's against them.,0.0
I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.,0.0
"In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.",0.0
My opponent was against that.,0.0
These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.,0.0
I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.,0.0
I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.,0.0
"And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.",0.0
Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.,0.0
"Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.",0.0
"You know, it's just not that simple.",0.0
"No, I'm not.",0.0
"I'm against the partial-birth abortion, but you've got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother.",0.0
"Secondly, with respect to parental notification, I'm not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who's been raped by her father and who's pregnant to have to notify her father.",0.0
So you got to have a judicial intervention.,0.0
"And because they didn't have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it.",0.0
It's never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe.,0.0
"Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?",0.0
Yes or no?,0.0
"And he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no.",0.0
And that's just the way it is.,0.0
That's a vote.,0.0
It came right up.,0.0
It's clear for everybody to see.,0.0
And as I said: You can run but you can't hide the reality.,0.0
Put a head fake on us.,0.0
"I have made a lot of decisions, and some of them little, like appointments to boards you never heard of, and some of them big.",0.0
"And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.",0.0
He shouldn't have made that decision.,0.0
And I'll take responsibility for them.,0.0
I'm human.,0.0
"But on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I'll stand by those decisions, because I think they're right.",0.0
"That's really what you're -- when they ask about the mistakes, that's what they're talking about.",0.0
"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq? """,0.0
"And the answer is, ""Absolutely not.""",0.0
It was the right decision.,0.0
"The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program.",0.0
And the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.,0.0
We knew he hated us.,0.0
We knew he'd been -- invaded other countries.,0.0
We knew he tortured his own people.,0.0
"On the tax cut, it's a big decision.",0.0
I did the right decision.,0.0
Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history.,0.0
"Now, you asked what mistakes.",0.0
"I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.",0.0
I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.,0.0
"I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U. N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort.",1.0
"I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts.",0.0
Gut-check time.,0.0
Was this really going to war as a last resort?,0.0
The president rushed our nation to war without a plan to win the peace.,0.0
And simple things weren't done.,0.0
That's why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services.,0.0
"That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.",1.0
"We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.",0.0
That ammo is now being used against our kids.,0.0
"Ten thousand out of 12,000 Humvees aren't armored.",0.0
"I visited some of those kids with no limbs today, because they didn't have the armor on those vehicles.",1.0
They didn't have the right body armor.,1.0
I've met parents who've on the Internet gotten the armor to send their kids.,0.0
There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.,1.0
"And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.",1.0
"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.""",0.0
"Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.",0.0
And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.,0.0
"The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, ""And the world would be a lot better off.""",1.0
"Not necessarily be in power, but here's what I'll say about the $87 billion.",0.0
I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.,0.0
He made a mistake in invading Iraq.,0.0
Which is a worse decision?,0.0
"Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability.",0.0
I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton.,1.0
"I also thought the wealthiest people in America ought to pay for it, ladies and gentlemen.",0.0
He wants your kids to pay for it.,0.0
"I wanted us to pay for it, since we're at war.",0.0
I don't think that's a bad decision.,0.0
Either way.,0.0
"Charlie, thank you.",0.0
And thank you all.,0.0
"Thank you, all of you, for taking part.",0.0
"Thanks for your questions tonight, very, very much.",0.0
Obviously the president and I both have very strong convictions.,0.0
I respect him for that.,0.0
But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.,0.0
I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation.,0.0
"I'll never give a veto over American security to any other entity -- not a nation, not a country, not an institution.",0.0
"But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances.",0.0
And that's the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it.,0.0
We are not doing that today.,0.0
We need to.,0.0
I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.,0.0
"But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.",0.0
"In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health-care costs going up.",0.0
I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans.,0.0
I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind.,0.0
I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents.,0.0
That's the test.,0.0
I believe America's best days are ahead of us.,1.0
"I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.",1.0
And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.,0.0
Thank you all very much.,0.0
It's been enjoyable.,0.0
"The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done.",0.0
"We've been through a lot together as a country -- been through a recession, corporate scandals, war.",0.0
And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months.,0.0
The farm income in America is high.,0.0
Small businesses are flourishing.,0.0
Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.,0.0
We're on the move.,1.0
"Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.",0.0
"And abroad, we're at war.",0.0
And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.,0.0
I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe.,1.0
The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe.,1.0
There is more work to be done.,0.0
We'll stay on the hunt on Al Qaida.,0.0
We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.,0.0
We'll make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.,0.0
The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.,1.0
But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty.,0.0
And we'll continue to promote freedom around the world.,0.0
Freedom is on the march.,1.0
"Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president.",1.0
"In Iraq, we'll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful.",1.0
God bless.,0.0
"Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight.",0.0
"Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.",0.0
And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task.,0.0
We're proud to be here.,0.0
"Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.",0.0
Will we ever be safe and secure again?,0.0
We absolutely must be.,0.0
That's the goal.,0.0
"Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.",0.0
"I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away.",0.0
"And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.",1.0
The measurement is not: Are we safer?,0.0
The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?,0.0
"And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected.",0.0
Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected.,0.0
That's not good enough.,0.0
"People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is.",0.0
Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.,0.0
Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.,0.0
So we can do a better job of homeland security.,0.0
"I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.",0.0
"I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.",0.0
"But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.",1.0
"Bob, thank you very much.",0.0
I want to thank Arizona State as well.,0.0
"Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.",0.0
"I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.",0.0
"As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend.",0.0
And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman.,0.0
Think about that.,0.0
Freedom is on the march.,0.0
We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.,0.0
"In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.",0.0
"My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.",0.0
I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.,0.0
I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.,0.0
"At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.",0.0
I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources.,0.0
My opponent voted against it.,0.0
We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.,0.0
But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.,0.0
"It just takes good, strong leadership.",0.0
Yes.,0.0
"When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.",0.0
"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """,0.0
"He said, ""I don't know.",0.0
I don't really think about him very much.,0.0
"I'm not that concerned. """,0.0
We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.,0.0
"Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden.",0.0
It's kind of one of those exaggerations.,0.0
Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.,0.0
We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.,0.0
We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.,0.0
My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement.,0.0
"No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.",0.0
"Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.",0.0
And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.,0.0
We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.,0.0
"My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year.",0.0
"Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.",0.0
"The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.",0.0
"I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.",0.0
We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America.,0.0
"Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.",0.0
One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.,0.0
"But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.",0.0
This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system.,0.0
It's not working for the American family.,0.0
And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.,0.0
Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.,0.0
"You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all.",0.0

"4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.",0.0
This president has turned his back on the wellness of America.,1.0
And there is no system.,0.0
"In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.",1.0
Children across our country don't have health care.,0.0
"We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.",1.0
I have a plan to cover all Americans.,0.0
We're going to make it affordable and accessible.,0.0
We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.,0.0
I would.,0.0
Thank you.,0.0
"I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.",0.0
He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get.,0.0
"That costs the government $7,700 per family.",0.0
"If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.",1.0
It's an empty promise.,1.0
It's called bait and switch.,1.0
"Actually, it's not an empty promise.",0.0
"It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan.",0.0
"He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.",0.0
What we do is we have choice.,0.0
I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield.,0.0
"Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.",0.0
"But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.",0.0
Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.,0.0
We're not giving this away for nothing.,0.0
"I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.",0.0
"During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules.",0.0
"If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.",0.0
President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.,1.0
He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.,1.0
6 million jobs lost.,1.0
He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.,1.0
"Now, I'm going to reverse that.",0.0
I'm going to change that.,0.0
We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.,0.0
"Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.",0.0
"And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.",0.0
We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.,0.0
"They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.",0.0
I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker.,0.0
And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound.,0.0
"I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.",0.0
I have a manufacturing jobs credit.,0.0
We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas.,0.0
We raise the student loans.,0.0
I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.,0.0
This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.,1.0
"Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.",0.0
He been a senator for 20 years.,0.0
He voted to increase taxes 98 times.,0.0
"When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.",0.0
"He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.",0.0
He talks about PAYGO.,0.0
"I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.",0.0
"2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.",0.0
There is a tax gap.,0.0
And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?,0.0
The middle class.,0.0
"I propose a detailed budget, Bob.",0.0
"I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.",0.0
It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.,0.0
"I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century.",0.0
And here's some help for you to go get an education.,0.0
Here's some help for you to go to a community college.,0.0
We've expanded trade adjustment assistance.,0.0
We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.,0.0
"You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing.",0.0
We talk about fiscal matters.,0.0
But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.,0.0
I went to Washington to solve problems.,0.0
And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.,0.0
"They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.",0.0
And so we said: Let's raise the standards.,0.0
"We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.",0.0
"No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job.",0.0
Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.,0.0
"Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.",0.0
And that's what I would say to that person.,0.0
I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.,0.0
"Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.",0.0
Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.,0.0
6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.,0.0
Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.,0.0
"But guess what, America?",0.0
The wages of Americans have gone down.,0.0
"The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.",0.0
And the president just walks on by this problem.,0.0
The fact is that he's cut job-training money.,0.0
They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.,0.0
They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.,0.0
They've cut the training money.,0.0
They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.,0.0
"I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.",0.0
I don't blame them entirely for it.,0.0
I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.,0.0
Outsourcing is going to happen.,0.0
I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country.,0.0
"I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?",0.0
"""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """,0.0
"What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.",0.0
"Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.",0.0
You get to defer your taxes.,0.0
"So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. """,0.0
That's not smart.,0.0
I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.,0.0
"And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.",1.0
And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.,0.0
The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field.,0.0
This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.,0.0
He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.,0.0
The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation.,0.0
There are companies that wanted to petition the administration.,0.0
They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.,0.0
The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.,0.0
I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker.,0.0
And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job.,0.0
That's what the American worker wants.,0.0
"And if we do that, we can have an impact.",0.0
"Plus, we need fiscal discipline.",0.0
"Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.",0.0
Let me start with the Pell Grants.,0.0
In his last litany of misstatements.,0.0
He said we cut Pell Grants.,0.0
We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.,0.0
That's a fact.,0.0
"You know, he talks to the workers.",0.0
Let me talk to the workers.,0.0
You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.,0.0
"If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit.",0.0
That's money in your pocket.,0.0
"If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.",0.0
"The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.",0.0
We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.,0.0
"A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.",0.0
It's your money.,0.0
"The way my opponent talks, he said, ""We're going to spend the government's money.",0.0
"""No, we're spending your money.",0.0
"And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.",0.0
"I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.",0.0
My opponent talks about fiscal sanity.,1.0
His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.,1.0
He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.,1.0
"Bob, anybody can play with these votes.",0.0
Everybody knows that.,0.0
I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times.,0.0
"I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for.",1.0
I voted for IRA tax cuts.,0.0
I voted for small-business tax cuts.,0.0
But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers?,1.0
Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.,1.0
"But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them.",1.0
They're getting less money.,1.0
That's not what we want.,0.0
"Senator, no one's playing with your votes.",0.0
You voted to increase taxes 98 times.,0.0
"When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.",0.0
He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times.,0.0
"You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.",0.0
"You know, Bob, I don't know.",0.0
I just don't know.,0.0
I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.,0.0
It's important that we do that.,0.0
And that's to be honored.,0.0
"But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.",0.0
I believe in the sanctity of marriage.,0.0
"I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.",0.0
I proposed a constitutional amendment.,0.0
"The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.",0.0
It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process.,0.0
"After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.",0.0
I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.,0.0
"You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.",0.0
My opponent was against it.,0.0
It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.,0.0
It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.,0.0
But I'm concerned that that will get overturned.,0.0
"And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.",0.0
"We're all God's children, Bob.",0.0
"And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.",1.0
"I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice.",0.0
"I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.",1.0
"And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.",1.0
I think we have to respect that.,0.0
The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.,0.0
I believe that.,0.0
I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.,0.0
"But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace.",1.0
You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.,0.0
You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital.,0.0
"You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.",0.0
"Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws.",0.0
"And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.",0.0
I respect their views.,0.0
I completely respect their views.,0.0
I am a Catholic.,0.0
And I grew up learning how to respect those views.,0.0
"But I disagree with them, as do many.",1.0
I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith.,0.0
What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.,0.0
I believe that choice is a woman's choice.,0.0
And that's why I support that.,0.0
"Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.",0.0
The president has never said whether or not he would do that.,1.0
But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.,1.0
I will not.,0.0
I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.,0.0
"Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.",0.0
I was an altar boy.,0.0
I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.,0.0
"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president.",0.0
"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """,0.0
"There's a great passage of the Bible that says, ""What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds?",0.0
"Faith without works is dead. """,0.0
"And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.",0.0
That's why I fight against poverty.,0.0
That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.,0.0
That's why I fight for equality and justice.,0.0
All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.,0.0
"But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.",1.0
And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.,0.0
I think it's important to promote a culture of life.,0.0
I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.,0.0
I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life.,0.0
"I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.",0.0
"Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.",0.0
It's a brutal practice.,0.0
People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.,0.0
It made a lot of sense.,0.0
"My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.",0.0
"What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.",0.0
"The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.",0.0
That's great.,0.0
I appreciate that very much.,0.0
All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.,0.0
"Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration.",0.0
Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process.,0.0
Most health-care costs are covered by third parties.,0.0
"And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.",0.0
And there's no market forces involved with health care.,0.0
It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.,0.0
"These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.",0.0
"Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis.",0.0
"Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America.",0.0
That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.,0.0
"Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.",0.0
"Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology.",0.0
"It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.",1.0
"And so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care.",0.0
We're beginning to do it.,0.0
We're changing the language.,0.0
"We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.",0.0
"People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.",1.0
"And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker.",0.0
"And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.",0.0
"The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.",0.0
Let me give you a prime example.,0.0
In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada.,0.0
"But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right.",0.0
The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada.,0.0
We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing.,0.0
The VA does that.,0.0
The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.,0.0
We could have done that in Medicare.,0.0
Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer.,0.0
Medicare belongs to you.,1.0
"Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.",0.0
"But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.",0.0
Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets.,0.0
That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.,0.0
"When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.",0.0
"Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.",0.0
"So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.",0.0
We got to have health care for all Americans.,1.0
"I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United States Senate for 20 years?",0.0
He has no record on reforming of health care.,0.0
No record at all.,0.0
He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five.,0.0
No record of leadership.,0.0
I came to Washington to solve problems.,0.0
I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.,0.0
And so I led.,0.0
"And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare.",0.0
"Once again, the president is misleading America.",1.0
"I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills.",0.0
"But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s.",0.0
And I'm very proud of that.,0.0
So the president's wrong.,1.0
"Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect.",1.0
One called it fiction.,1.0
The other called it untrue.,1.0
"The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple.",0.0
It gives you the choice.,0.0
I don't force you to do anything.,0.0
It's not a government plan.,0.0
The government doesn't require you to do anything.,0.0
You choose your doctor.,0.0
You choose your plan.,0.0
"If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.",0.0
And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today.,0.0
Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.,0.0
"And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.",0.0
It's their choice.,0.0
"I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.",0.0
"We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.",0.0
"If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American.",0.0
"I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.  You want to buy into it, you can.",0.0
We give you broader competition.,0.0
That helps lower prices.,0.0
"In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.",0.0
"And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.",0.0
"Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.",0.0
It works.,0.0
And I'm going to offer it to America.,0.0
"In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.",0.0
"Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report.",0.0
They analyzed the senator's plan.,0.0
It cost $1.2 trillion.,0.0
"The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.",0.0
It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.,0.0
"If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees.",0.0
Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them?,0.0
It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.,0.0
We have a fundamental difference of opinion.,0.0
"I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.",0.0
"Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls.",0.0
And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care.,1.0
They have poor-quality health care.,1.0
"Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.",1.0
The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality.,0.0
"Now, maybe that explains why he hasn't fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining.",0.0
Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.,0.0
He doesn't adequately fund it.,0.0
But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.,0.0
That's not what I have.,0.0
I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield.,0.0
Senators and congressmen have a wide choice.,0.0
Americans ought to have it too.,0.0
That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.,0.0
"Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.",0.0
We're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country.,0.0
We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.,0.0
"Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.",0.0
"First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.",0.0
"I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away.",0.0
"Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks.",0.0
"There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem.",0.0
"And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.",1.0
And so I think we need to think differently.,0.0
We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.,0.0
"And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue.",0.0
"It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat.",0.0
And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.,0.0
"I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust.",0.0
And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.,0.0
I will work with Republicans and Democrats.,0.0
It'll be a vital issue in my second term.,0.0
"But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.",1.0
You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.,0.0
"Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.",1.0
"The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.",1.0
And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.,1.0
"Now, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from?",0.0
"He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for.",1.0
Not one of them are paid for.,1.0
The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history.,1.0
He's broken the pay-as-you-go rules.,0.0
I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility.,0.0
"In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party.",0.0
We balanced the budget in the '90s.,0.0
We paid down the debt for two years.,0.0
And that's what we're going to do.,0.0
We're going to protect Social Security.,0.0
I will not privatize it.,0.0
I will not cut the benefits.,0.0
And we're going to be fiscally responsible.,0.0
And we will take care of Social Security.,0.0
Not at all.,0.0
"Absolutely not, Bob.",0.0
"This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on ""Meet the Press"" with Tim Russert in 1990-something.",0.0
We heard the same thing.,0.0
We fixed it.,0.0
"In fact, we put together a $5.",0.0
6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security.,0.0
If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.,0.0
The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.,0.0
"Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut.",0.0
I don't.,0.0
"I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.",0.0
"And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.",0.0
"Now, we can do that.",0.0
"Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country.",0.0
We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.,0.0
And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.,0.0
But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America.,0.0
"The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.",0.0
"And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.",1.0
"Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.",1.0
I have a plan to put America back to work.,0.0
"And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.",0.0
He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time.,1.0
I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security.,1.0
I heard more of the same.,0.0
He talks about middle-class tax cuts.,0.0
That's exactly where the tax cuts went.,0.0
Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.,0.0
And now the tax code is more fair.,0.0
Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.,0.0
People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed.,0.0
"If you have a child, you got tax relief.",0.0
"If you're married, you got tax relief.",0.0
"If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief.",0.0
All of which was opposed by my opponent.,0.0
And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession.,0.0
"People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.",0.0
And it was one of the largest declines in our history.,0.0
"And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.",0.0
But we acted.,0.0
I led the Congress.,0.0
We passed tax relief.,0.0
9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.,0.0
"Sure, there's more work to do.",0.0
But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.,0.0
It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low.,0.0
I see it as a serious problem.,0.0
"I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue.",0.0
We're increasing the border security of the United States.,0.0
"We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.",0.0
We're using new equipment.,0.0
We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.,0.0
And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.,0.0
It's a subject I'm very familiar with.,0.0
"After all, I was a border governor for a while.",0.0
Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons.,0.0
They're coming here to work.,0.0
"15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.",0.0
And that's what's happening.,0.0
"And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.",0.0
That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.,0.0
"It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families.",0.0
"See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.",0.0
It also means it takes pressure off the border.,0.0
"If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border.",0.0
It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.,0.0
"Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty.",0.0
I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.,0.0
There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.,0.0
And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.,0.0
"If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.",0.0
And here is where my opponent and I differ.,0.0
"In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.",0.0
"Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.",0.0
"The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.",0.0
"And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs.",0.0
"The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929.",0.0
And the take-home pay of the richest .,0.0
1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928.,0.0
"Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.",0.0
Now that's wrong.,0.0
"Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform.",0.0
He said he would reform it.,0.0
Four years later he is now promising another plan.,0.0
"Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.",0.0
"The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will.",0.0
"Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem.",0.0
The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring.,0.0
"It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.",0.0
"And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American.",0.0
"We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.",0.0
"Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.",0.0
They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.,0.0
We have much more manpower and much more equipment there.,0.0
"He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.",1.0
That is an outrageous claim.,1.0
And we'll continue to protect our borders.,0.0
We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.,0.0
"The fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border.",0.0
And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.,0.0
We have iris-identification technology.,0.0
"We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today.",0.0
"We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.",0.0
We could speed it up.,0.0
There are huge delays.,0.0
"The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure.",0.0
"Well, I'm glad you raised that question.",0.0
It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.,0.0
"And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.",0.0
We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.,0.0
But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it.,0.0
We're not allowed to vote on it.,0.0
They don't want to raise the minimum wage.,0.0
The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years.,0.0
"If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9.",0.0
"2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year.",0.0
The president has denied 9.,1.0
"2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.",1.0
"One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families.",1.0
What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.,0.0
We also need to hold on to equal pay.,0.0
Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.,0.0
That's not right in America.,0.0
And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women's pay.,0.0
They've cut it off.,1.0
They've stopped it.,1.0
They don't enforce these kinds of things.,1.0
"Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.",0.0
"We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream.",0.0
"And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.",0.0
I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.,1.0
"Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage.",0.0
But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to.,0.0
And that's to make sure the education system works.,0.0
It's to make sure we raise standards.,0.0
"Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.",0.0
"The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards.",0.0
We'll increase federal spending.,0.0
"But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. """,0.0
You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem.,0.0
And we weren't diagnosing problems.,0.0
And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school.,0.0
And guess who would get shuffled through?,0.0
Children whose parents wouldn't speak English as a first language just move through.,0.0
Many inner-city kids just move through.,0.0
We've stopped that practice now by measuring early.,0.0
"And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it.",0.0
"I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, ""Reading is the new civil right,"" and she's right.",1.0
"In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now.",0.0
"You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.",1.0
"What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?",0.0
"And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test.",0.0
"I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.",0.0
Is that a new question or a 30-second question?,0.0
Which time limit.,0.0
Thank you very much.,0.0
"Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.",0.0
I'll answer it straight to America.,0.0
"I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.",0.0
And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right.,0.0
So I don't intend to see it undone.,0.0
"Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.",0.0
But let me go a step further.,0.0
We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.,0.0
And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.,0.0
"Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens.",0.0
The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.,0.0
"He'll tell you he's raised the money, and he has.",0.0
"But he didn't put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children.",0.0
Two things.,0.0
"One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with.",1.0
"And secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough.",1.0
We've increased funds.,0.0
"But more importantly, we've reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they're too late.",0.0
He talked about the unemployed.,0.0
Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.,0.0
He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language?,0.0
And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does.,0.0
You don't measure it by a percentage increase.,0.0
"Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done.",0.0
Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget.,0.0
"Now, that's not in my gut.",0.0
"That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut.",0.0
You be the judge.,0.0
"Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces.",0.0
Our military is overextended.,0.0
"Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.",0.0
"One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.",0.0
"Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.",0.0
"In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve.",0.0
And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.,0.0
There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security.,0.0
We ought to be doing that.,0.0
And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.,0.0
"But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.",1.0
"I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war.",0.0
He said he would work through a real alliance.,0.0
"He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.",0.0
"Well, we didn't.",0.0
And the result is our forces today are overextended.,0.0
The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result.,0.0
"And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably.",0.0
And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.,0.0
"The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing.",0.0
"We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year.",0.0
"I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.",0.0
Some of them had been there before.,0.0
The people I talked to their spirits were high.,0.0
They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.,0.0
They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.,0.0
"My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.",0.0
In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test.,0.0
"In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval.",0.0
That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.,0.0
I'll work with allies.,0.0
I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation.,0.0
"In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.",0.0
No nation will ever have a veto over us.,0.0
"But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard.",1.0
"That's how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that's how you gain legitimacy in the world.",0.0
But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America.,1.0
"In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.",0.0
"The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force.",0.0
Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.,0.0
"Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.",0.0
"I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.",0.0
I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun.,0.0
I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.,0.0
But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.,0.0
And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.,0.0
And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.,0.0
Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.,0.0
"To me, that's the best way to secure America.",0.0
I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.,1.0
I am a hunter.,0.0
I'm a gun owner.,0.0
"I've been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old.",0.0
And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment.,0.0
But I'll tell you this.,0.0
I'm also a former law enforcement officer.,0.0

I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.,0.0
I've broken up organized crime.,0.0
I know something about prosecuting.,0.0
And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban.,0.0
They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47.,0.0
"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?",1.0

"Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous.",1.0
"Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.",0.0
"And that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan.",0.0
So I believe America's less safe.,0.0
"If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, ""Sorry, we don't have the votes,"" I'd have said, ""Then we're going to have a fight. """,0.0
And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.,0.0
We'd have won what Bill Clinton won.,0.0
"No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along.",0.0
And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.,0.0
I'll give you an example.,0.0
I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time.,0.0
Now I'm the senior Democrat on it.,0.0
"We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country.",0.0
They don't reach those goals.,0.0
They don't even fight to reach those goals.,0.0
They've tried to undo them.,0.0
"The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination.",0.0
And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.,0.0
Some people have a mistaken view of it in America.,0.0
"It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.",0.0
"I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably.",0.0
"If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.",0.0
"During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.",0.0
"And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching.",0.0
"So we had a policy called ""Mend it, don't end it.",0.0
"""We fixed it.",0.0
"And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel.",0.0
"As president, I will make certain we travel it.",0.0
"Now, let me just share something.",0.0
"This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.",0.0

This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.,0.0

"I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it.",0.0
"Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.",0.0

We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students.,0.0

"Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong.",0.0
I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.,0.0
Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before.,0.0
"And that's hopeful, and that's positive.",1.0
"Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith.",0.0
I think it's important and I share it.,0.0
I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty.,0.0
Everything is a gift from the Almighty.,0.0
"And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.",0.0

"I was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.",0.0

We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.,0.0
"There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.",0.0
And we're struggling with that today.,0.0
And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith.,0.0
I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead.,0.0
I think we've got a lot more work to do.,0.0
"And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America.",0.0
Very much so.,0.0
"Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.",0.0
"I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job.",0.0
"And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress.",0.0
"And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans.",0.0
That's where we were.,0.0
That's not where we are today.,0.0
"I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country.",1.0
I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States.,1.0
I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.,1.0
We have to change that.,0.0
"And as president, I am committed to changing that.",0.0
I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.,0.0
I think we have to come together and work to change it.,0.0

"And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.",0.0
My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is.,1.0

And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow.,0.0
But Washington is a tough town.,0.0
"And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.",0.0
"I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.",0.0
My opponent said this is a bitterly divided time.,0.0

"We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did.",0.0
John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq.,1.0

(LAUGHTER)  To stand up straight and not scowl.,0.0

"And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.",0.0
"Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up.",0.0
(LAUGHTER)  And some would say maybe me more so than others.,0.0
(LAUGHTER)  But I can take it.,0.0
"(LAUGHTER)  Can I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didn't ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run.",0.0

"And she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said, ""Remember: integrity, integrity, integrity.",0.0
"""Those are the three words that she left me with.",0.0
"And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong.",0.0
They also kick me around.,0.0
They keep me honest.,0.0
They don't let me get away with anything.,0.0
I can sometimes take myself too seriously.,0.0
They surely don't let me do that.,0.0

"My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division.",0.0
"More than ever, we need to be united as a country.",0.0
"And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea.",0.0
I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.,0.0
These are dangerous times.,0.0
"I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world.",0.0

We can lift our schools up.,0.0
We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we're losing overseas.,0.0
We can have health care for all Americans.,0.0
We can further the cause of equality in our nation.,0.0
Let me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security.,0.0
"Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love.",0.0
"And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher.",0.0
I believe we can do better.,0.0

I ask you for your help.,0.0
"I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever.",0.0

"And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.",0.0

"We reformed our school system, and now there's an achievement gap in America that's beginning to close.",0.0

"I'm optimistic that we'll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose.",0.0
We must never waver in the face of this enemy that -- these ideologues of hate.,0.0

I want to thank you for listening tonight.,0.0
I'm asking for your vote.,0.0
God bless you.,0.0
"Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.",0.0
I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.,0.0
"You know, we are at a defining moment in our history.",0.0
"Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",0.0
"And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.",0.0
"And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?",0.0
How's it going to affect my job?,0.0
How's it going to affect my house?,0.0
How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?,0.0
"So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.",0.0
And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.,0.0
"Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.",0.0
"Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.",0.0
"Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.",0.0
"And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.",0.0
"Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.",1.0
It hasn't worked.,1.0
And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.,0.0
"That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.",0.0
"Well, thank you, Jim.",0.0
And thanks to everybody.,0.0
And I do have a sad note tonight.,0.0
Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.,0.0
He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us.,0.0
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.,0.0
I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.,0.0
So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.,0.0
"But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why.",0.0
"Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.",0.0
And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis.,0.0
And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street.,0.0
"We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while.",0.0
"But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.",0.0
This package has transparency in it.,0.0
It has to have accountability and oversight.,0.0
"It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans.",0.0
We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.,0.0
"And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives.",0.0
"And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that.",0.0
And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.,0.0
But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.,0.0
"This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.",0.0
And we've got a lot of work to do.,0.0
And we've got to create jobs.,0.0
"And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.",0.0
We haven't seen the language yet.,0.0
And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.,0.0
"So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.",0.0
"The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?",0.0
"Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.",0.0
"Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.",0.0
"So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.",0.0
And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.,0.0
"But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?",0.0
We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.,0.0
And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.,0.0
"But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.",0.0
A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.,0.0
But there's also the issue of responsibility.,0.0
You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.,0.0
"President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.",0.0
"One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.",0.0
"And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.",0.0
Somehow we've lost that accountability.,0.0
I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.,0.0
"We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.",0.0
"But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.",0.0
"As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.",0.0
"Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.",0.0
And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.,0.0
I do not think that they are.,0.0
"Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",0.0
The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.,0.0
"And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on.",0.0
They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.,0.0
We haven't been paying attention to them.,0.0
"And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.",0.0
"No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system.",0.0
We've got fundamental problems in the system.,0.0
"And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D. C., and in the Wall Street.",0.0
So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go.,0.0
"And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.",0.0
But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker.,0.0
"And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.",0.0
"America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.",0.0
"But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America.",0.0
"And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.",0.0
"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.",0.0
It's completely out of control.,0.0
It's gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society.,0.0
"We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us.",0.0
"And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway.",1.0
It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.,1.0
And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.,1.0
"You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.",0.0
"I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.",0.0
And it has got to be brought under control.,0.0
"As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen.",0.0
This one's kind of old.,0.0
"I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk.",0.0
I will make them famous.,0.0
You will know their names.,0.0
"Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.",0.0
"He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.",0.0
"I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects.",0.0
"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.",0.0
"And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.",0.0
But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.,0.0
"Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.",0.0
"Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.",0.0
"And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.",0.0
"So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.",0.0
"What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.",0.0
"And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.",0.0
"And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.",1.0
Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.,0.0
"He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.",0.0
Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money.,0.0
"But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.",0.0
"""It's only $18 billion.""",0.0
Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?,0.0
Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people?,0.0
It corrupts people.,0.0
"That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.",0.0
It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.,0.0
I have fought against it my career.,0.0
I have fought against it.,0.0
"I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.",0.0
I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.,0.0
"Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.",0.0
"Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.",0.0
I want to cut spending.,0.0
I want to keep taxes low.,0.0
The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.,0.0
I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures.,0.0
Let's just be clear.,0.0
"What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States.",0.0
I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.,0.0
I think those are pretty important priorities.,0.0
And I pay for every dime of it.,0.0
But let's go back to the original point.,0.0
"John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.",0.0
"And, absolutely, we need earmark reform.",0.0
"And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.",0.0
But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.,0.0
"And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.",1.0
"Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.",0.0
Ireland pays 11 percent.,0.0
"Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.",0.0
I want to cut that business tax.,0.0
I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.,0.0
"But, again, I want to return.",0.0
It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.,0.0
"I can tell you, it's rife.",0.0
It's throughout.,0.0
"The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.",1.0
Look at them.,1.0
You'll be appalled.,1.0
"And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.",0.0
"So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts.",0.0
"I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.",0.0
"I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.",0.0
"I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich.""",0.0
"Well, let me just make a couple of points.",0.0
My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.,0.0
"And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.",0.0
"Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.",0.0
"Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.",0.0
"And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.",0.0
It's not like you want to close the loopholes.,0.0
You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.,0.0
And that's a problem.,0.0
"Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.",0.0
"Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.",0.0
"So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.",0.0
Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.,0.0
"And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.",0.0
It is not a good deal for the American people.,0.0
"But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.",0.0
"I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.",0.0
We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.,0.0
It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments.,0.0
"It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.",0.0
I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.,0.0
You've got to look at our record.,0.0
You've got to look at our records.,0.0
That's the important thing.,0.0
Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending?,1.0
Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?,0.0
Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?,0.0
"And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.",0.0
"Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.",0.0
"And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill.",0.0
"But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions.",0.0
"He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.",0.0
And that's just a fact.,0.0
"Again, you can look it up.",0.0
"Look, it's just not true.",0.0
"And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.",0.0
"Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.",0.0
"But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.",0.0
"No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out.",0.0
"We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.",0.0
"Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.",0.0
We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.,0.0
"The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.",0.0
But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.,0.0
There are some things that I think have to be done.,0.0
"We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.",0.0
"We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families.",0.0
Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.,0.0
"They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.",0.0
I'm meeting folks all over the country.,0.0
"We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.",0.0
The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.,0.0
We've got to invest in science and technology.,0.0
China had a space launch and a space walk.,0.0
We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.,0.0
And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.,0.0
"And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.",0.0
"Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.",0.0
So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.,0.0
We can't shortchange those things.,0.0
"We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.",0.0
"Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending.",0.0
"We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control.",0.0
Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.,0.0
It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.,0.0
"The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.",0.0
"First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies.",0.0
I oppose ethanol subsidies.,0.0
"I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts.",0.0
We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.,0.0
"We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it.",0.0
So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.,0.0
"We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.",0.0
I know how to do that.,0.0
But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.,0.0
... deferred and delayed.,0.0
"Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.",0.0
That is a big project.,0.0
That is a multi-year project.,0.0
Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.,0.0
We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.,0.0
They just skim off $15 billion.,0.0
That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.,0.0
"How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.",0.0
I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.,0.0
The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.,0.0
There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.,0.0
"I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense.",0.0
We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.,0.0
"It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.",0.0
"Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much.",0.0
Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.,0.0
"We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.",0.0
Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.,0.0
"You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030.",0.0
There is no doubt about it.,0.0
"Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.",0.0
"If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.",0.0
"The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.",0.0
"Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan.",0.0
Not the federal government.,0.0
We have to obviously cut spending.,0.0
I have fought to cut spending.,0.0
Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.,0.0
I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.,0.0
"We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.",0.0
And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.,0.0
"And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control.",0.0
We owe China $500 billion.,0.0
"So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.",0.0
It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration.,0.0
I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.,0.0
I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.,0.0
"Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated.",1.0
And then the war was very badly mishandled.,1.0
"I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.",1.0
"This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it.",1.0
"And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.",1.0
This strategy has succeeded.,1.0
And we are winning in Iraq.,1.0
And we will come home with victory and with honor.,0.0
And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.,0.0
"And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.",0.0
The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.,0.0
It would have been increase in sectarian violence.,0.0
"It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.",0.0
So there was a lot at stake there.,0.0
"And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.",0.0
"And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home.",0.0
And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.,0.0
"Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.",0.0
"Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.",0.0
We hadn't caught bin Laden.,0.0
"We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.",0.0
Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.,0.0
"And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case.",0.0
"We have lost over 4,000 lives.",1.0
"We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.",1.0
We took our eye off the ball.,0.0
"And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.",0.0
"So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.",0.0
But we have to use our military wisely.,0.0
And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.,0.0
The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.,0.0
"The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind.",0.0
That's the decision of the next president of the United States.,0.0
"Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure.",0.0
"Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.",0.0
"But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.",0.0
"Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.",0.0
Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan.,0.0
"To this day, he has never had a hearing.",0.0
"I mean, it's remarkable.",0.0
Which point?,0.0
But that's Senate inside baseball.,0.0
But let's get back to the core issue here.,0.0
Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.,0.0
"They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.",0.0
"But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.",0.0
"And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.",0.0
You talk about the surge.,0.0
"The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.",0.0
You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.,0.0
You were wrong.,0.0
You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.,0.0
And you were wrong.,0.0
I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.,0.0
"But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad.",0.0
"General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.",0.0
I was honored to be there.,0.0
I was honored to speak to those troops.,0.0
"And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.",0.0
And you know what they said to us?,0.0
"They said, let us win.",0.0
We don't want our kids coming back here.,0.0
"And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.",0.0
Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.,0.0
"There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.",0.0
They inform on the bad guys.,0.0
"And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.",0.0
"That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.",0.0
It was a strategy.,0.0
And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general.,0.0
"And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.",0.0
"Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.",0.0
"First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.",0.0
"Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.",1.0
"I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.",0.0
We had a difference on the timetable.,0.0
We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.,0.0
"We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.",0.0
And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.,0.0
"The question is, was this wise?",0.0
"We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.",0.0
We need more troops there.,0.0
We need more resources there.,0.0
"Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?",0.0
We've been successful in Afghanistan.,0.0
There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.,0.0
"This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.",0.0
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.,0.0
But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.,0.0
"Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly.",0.0
We should do it in phases.,0.0
"But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.",0.0
"And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.",0.0
Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America.,1.0
That's not the case.,0.0
... withdrawal would be dangerous.,0.0
That's not true.,0.0
And also General Petraeus said the same thing.,0.0
"Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.",0.0
"Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.",0.0
"But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.",0.0
"Yes, I think we need more troops.",0.0
I've been saying that for over a year now.,0.0
"And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.",0.0
We had the highest fatalities among U. S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.,0.0
And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.,1.0
They are feeling emboldened.,0.0
"And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.",0.0
So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.,0.0
"Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.",0.0
"And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.",0.0
"So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.",0.0
It's not just more troops.,0.0
We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.,0.0
And I've said this to President Karzai.,0.0
"Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.",0.0
"Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.",1.0
"And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.",1.0
"First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.",1.0
So we can't ignore those lessons of history.,0.0
"Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.",1.0
I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.,1.0
"So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.",1.0
We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.,0.0
He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.,0.0
"Now, you don't do that.",0.0
You don't say that out loud.,0.0
"If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.",0.0
"Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full.",0.0
And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.,0.0
I've been to Waziristan.,0.0
I can see how tough that terrain is.,0.0
It's ruled by a handful of tribes.,0.0
"And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq.",0.0
And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.,0.0
And it's going to be tough.,0.0
They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban.,0.0
But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.,0.0
And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.,0.0
"But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.",0.0
So it's not just the addition of troops that matters.,0.0
It's a strategy that will succeed.,1.0
And Pakistan is a very important element in this.,1.0
And I know how to work with them.,1.0
And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.,1.0
Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.,0.0
"And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.",0.0
"Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.",0.0
"And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.",0.0
I think this is the right strategy.,0.0
"Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.",0.0
This is not an easy situation.,0.0
And we've got a choice.,0.0
"We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.",0.0
"And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.",0.0
"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator.""",0.0
"And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.",0.0
We spent $10 billion.,0.0
"And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.",0.0
That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.,0.0
I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.,1.0
"Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.",0.0
"But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.",0.0
"Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.",0.0
"And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference.",0.0
"Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.",1.0
And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.,0.0
I supported -- I supported that.,0.0
"I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia.",0.0
"That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.",0.0
I supported what we did in Kosovo.,0.0
I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.,0.0
"And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.",0.0
So I have a record.,0.0
"I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way.",0.0
"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it.""",1.0
"He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year.",1.0
"This was last August, a year ago.",1.0
"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor.""",1.0
"And this was August, a year ago.",1.0
"And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain.""",1.0
"That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.",1.0
And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.,1.0
I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated.,0.0
"A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated.",0.0
And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.,0.0
"Jim, let me just make a point.",0.0
"I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.",1.0
"She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.",1.0
No U. S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.,0.0
And we honor all the service that they've provided.,0.0
Our troops have performed brilliantly.,0.0
"The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.",1.0
"And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.",1.0
And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.,0.0
"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan.",0.0
You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.,0.0
You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.,0.0
"And when I'm president, I will.",0.0
"By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.",0.0
But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.,0.0
"So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.",0.0
"But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.",1.0
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.,1.0
"My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.",0.0
Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.,0.0
Let's just make that very clear.,0.0
"What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk.",0.0
The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.,0.0
"I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world's economic power.",0.0
"We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.",0.0
"The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.",0.0
"So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.",0.0
"But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.",0.0
And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.,0.0
"What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran.",0.0
"There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror.",0.0
Senator Obama said that would be provocative.,0.0
So this is a serious threat.,1.0
"This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.",0.0
"Well, let me just correct something very quickly.",0.0
I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.,0.0
I've consistently said so.,0.0
What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq.,0.0
To deal with Iran.,0.0
"And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.",0.0
Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.,0.0
That was cleared away.,0.0
And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.,0.0
"They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.",0.0
"So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.",0.0
"Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran.",0.0
It would be a game changer.,0.0
"Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.",0.0
Now here's what we need to do.,0.0
We do need tougher sanctions.,0.0
"I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.",0.0
"But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.",0.0
"It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.",0.0
"In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.",0.0
That will change when I'm president of the United States.,0.0
Without precondition.,0.0
"The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.",0.0
"Or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went.",0.0
"Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.",0.0
"Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.",0.0
"Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.",0.0
So let's talk about this.,0.0
"First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.",0.0
So he may not be the right person to talk to.,0.0
"But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.",0.0
"And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.",0.0
"Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.",0.0
This is one of your own advisers.,0.0
"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions.""",0.0
It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.,0.0
"What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you.""",0.0
There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.,0.0
"Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.",0.0
But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.,0.0
And you know what?,0.0
"President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.",0.0
"Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.",1.0
"And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks.",0.0
They're a member of the axis of evil.,0.0
We can't deal with them.,0.0
And you know what happened?,0.0
They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.,0.0
They tested a nuke.,0.0
They tested missiles.,0.0
They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.,0.0
"And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.",0.0
"When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.",0.0
"And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.",0.0
"He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.",0.0
"I mean, Spain?",0.0
Spain is a NATO ally.,0.0
"If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.",0.0
I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.,0.0
I don't even have a seal yet.,0.0
"Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad.",0.0
He did not say that.,0.0
He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.,0.0
I've always encouraged them.,0.0
The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.,0.0
"What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a ""stinking corpse,"" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments.",0.0
This is dangerous.,1.0
It isn't just naive; it's dangerous.,1.0
And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.,0.0
"As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea.",0.0
"By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.",1.0
"The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.",0.0
"We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.",0.0
"And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's ""trust, but verify,"" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous.",0.0
"Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.",0.0
"Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it.",0.0
This is a mischaracterization of my position.,0.0
When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.,0.0
"And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.",0.0
And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.,0.0
So let me get this right.,0.0
"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?",0.0
"Oh, please.",0.0
I've known him for 35 years.,0.0
"Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.",0.0
We do that all the time.,0.0
I am not parsing words.,0.0
I'm using the same words that your advisers use.,0.0
"Please, go ahead.",0.0
I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11.,0.0
"I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.",1.0
"And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.",0.0
"I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.",0.0
"But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.",0.0
"And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.",0.0
"And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.",0.0
"And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40.",0.0
And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.,0.0
"I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.",0.0
So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.,0.0
We have to do a better job in human intelligence.,0.0
We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.,0.0
We have to work more closely with our allies.,0.0
"I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.",0.0
But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.,0.0
But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.,0.0
"And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.",0.0
And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.,0.0
"But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",0.0
"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.",0.0
"Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.",0.0
"We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.",0.0
We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.,0.0
We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.,0.0
And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.,0.0
It's in a suitcase.,0.0
This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.,0.0
It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.,0.0
And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.,0.0
"And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.",0.0
"The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida.",0.0
They are now operating in 60 countries.,0.0
We can't simply be focused on Iraq.,0.0
"We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.",0.0
That's going to be critical.,0.0
We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.,0.0
And one last point I want to make.,0.0
"It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.",0.0
And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.,0.0
We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.,1.0
And this is the greatest country on Earth.,1.0
"But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.",0.0
"That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense.",0.0
And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.,0.0
We seem to come full circle again.,0.0
"Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.",0.0
They would establish a base in Iraq.,0.0
"The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.",0.0
"All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.",0.0
"And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.",0.0
And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.,0.0
That is the central issue of our time.,0.0
And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.,0.0
"Oh, there's no doubt.",0.0
"Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.",0.0
That has been their priority.,0.0
That has been where all our resources have gone.,0.0
"In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.",1.0
He is not captured.,1.0
He is not killed.,1.0
Al Qaida is resurgent.,0.0
"In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.",0.0
They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.,0.0
"And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa.",0.0
"They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.",0.0
"We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.",0.0
We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.,0.0
And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.,0.0
"We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.",0.0
There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.,0.0
So this is a national security issue.,0.0
We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.,0.0
"I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, ""How can I get disability payments?",0.0
"I've got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can't get treatment.""",0.0
"So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.",0.0
What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.,0.0
That's been missing over the last eight years.,0.0
That sense is something that I want to restore.,0.0
"I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years.",0.0
"There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.",0.0
"And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.",1.0
"As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans.",0.0
I know them well.,0.0
And I know that they know that I'll take care of them.,0.0
And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.,0.0
And I love them.,0.0
And I'll take care of them.,0.0
And they know that I'll take care of them.,0.0
"But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.",0.0
"Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.",0.0
I don't think I need any on-the-job training.,0.0
I'm ready to go at it right now.,0.0
"Well, let me just make a closing point.",0.0
"You know, my father came from Kenya.",0.0
That's where I get my name.,0.0
"And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried.",0.0
The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.,0.0
"I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.",0.0
"And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.",0.0
And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.,0.0
"Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad.",0.0
"And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.",0.0
"I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.",0.0
"Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question.",0.0
I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,0.0
"And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.",0.0
"And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.",0.0
It hasn't worked out that way.,0.0
And so now we've got to take some decisive action.,0.0
"Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week.",0.0
We've got to make sure that works properly.,0.0
"And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.",0.0
It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.,0.0
"And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.",0.0
"And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.",0.0
But that's only step one.,0.0
The middle-class need a rescue package.,0.0
And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.,0.0
It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes.,0.0
It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.,0.0
"And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families.",1.0
You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.,0.0
"Well, thank you, Tom.",0.0
"Thank you, Belmont University.",0.0
"And Senator Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.",0.0
"And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question.",0.0
You go to the heart of America's worries tonight.,0.0
"Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful.",1.0
It's our job to fix the problem.,0.0
"Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence.",0.0
We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much.,0.0
We have to keep Americans' taxes low.,0.0
All Americans' taxes low.,0.0
Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.,0.0
We obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington.,0.0
"Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?",0.0
We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.,0.0
"And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.",0.0
You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments.,0.0
"As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.",0.0
Is it expensive?,0.0
Yes.,0.0
"But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy.",0.0
And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.,0.0
"I know how the do that, my friends.",0.0
"And it's my proposal, it's not Senator Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal.",0.0
"But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans.",0.0
Thank you.,0.0
"Not you, Tom.",0.0
"You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans.",0.0
"But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.",0.0
A supporter of Senator Obama's is Warren Buffett.,0.0
"He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.",0.0
"I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.",0.0
She knows how to create jobs.,0.0
Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay.,0.0
Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.,0.0
But the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence.,0.0
"Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.",0.0
But there are other folks out there.,0.0
The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.,0.0
Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.,0.0
We've got to help the middle class.,0.0
"And we've -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.",0.0
"Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined.",0.0
"For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.",0.0
"And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.",1.0
Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.,0.0
But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.,0.0
That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.,0.0
And thanks to Hofstra.,0.0
"And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.",0.0
"It's good to see you again, Senator Obama.",0.0
"Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry.",1.0
"They're hurting, and they're angry.",1.0
And they want this country to go in a new direction.,0.0
And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.,0.0
"But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.",0.0
Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.,0.0
The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.,1.0
"I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.",0.0
"Now, we have allocated $750 billion.",0.0
"Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.",0.0
"Now, I know the criticism of this.",0.0
"Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?",0.0
That paid their mortgage payments?,0.0
It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.,0.0
And so we've got to reverse this.,0.0
We ought to put the homeowners first.,0.0
And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.,0.0
"Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.",0.0
I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,1.0
Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.,0.0
And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.,0.0
But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.,0.0
Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.,0.0
So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.,0.0
"Number one, let's focus on jobs.",0.0
I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.,0.0
"Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.",0.0
Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.,0.0
That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.,0.0
"I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.",0.0
And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.,0.0
"Last point I want to make, though.",0.0
We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.,0.0
We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.,0.0
We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.,0.0
No.,0.0
"I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.",0.0
"Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day.",0.0
And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.,0.0
"You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.",0.0
"Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich.",0.0
"Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.",0.0
And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income.,0.0
That's 16 million jobs in America.,0.0
And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.,0.0
That's what Joe believes.,0.0
He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.,0.0
Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.,0.0
I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.,0.0
"And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.",0.0
"Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.",0.0
"Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.",0.0
"What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent.",0.0
"If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax.",0.0
"In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.",0.0
"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.""",0.0
"And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.",0.0
And that requires us to make some important choices.,0.0
They produce the most jobs.,0.0
"You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.",0.0
"In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.",0.0
I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.,0.0
You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.,0.0
"The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.",0.0
"I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.",0.0
Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?,0.0
"Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.",0.0
If I can answer the question.,0.0
"Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.",0.0
"So, look, nobody likes taxes.",0.0
"I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself.",0.0
"But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.",0.0
Nobody likes taxes.,0.0
Let's not raise anybody's taxes.,0.0
OK?,0.0
"Well, I don't mind paying a little more.",0.0
The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.,0.0
Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.,0.0
"Ireland, it's 11 percent.",0.0
Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?,0.0
We need to cut the business tax rate in America.,1.0
We need to encourage business.,1.0
"Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes.",1.0
"We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.",1.0
"Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.",0.0
But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.,0.0
"Now, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut.",0.0
I haven't made a promise about...,0.0
Absolutely.,0.0
So let me get to that.,0.0
"What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go.",0.0
"Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.",0.0
"And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.",0.0
It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better.,0.0
It's not improving our health care system.,0.0
It's just a giveaway.,0.0
We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work.,0.0
"And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut.",0.0
"Programs that we need, we should make them work better.",0.0
"Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people.",0.0
I mentioned health care earlier.,0.0
"If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.",0.0
"If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.",0.0
"If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.",0.0
"But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.",1.0
"And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.",0.0
"Well, thank you, Bob.",0.0
I just want to get back to this home ownership.,0.0
"During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.",0.0
And they went out and bought up these mortgages.,0.0
"And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.",0.0
"And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago.",0.0
"So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.",0.0
We have to have nuclear power.,0.0
We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.,0.0
"It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed.",0.0
And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.,0.0
"I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK?",0.0
Some people say that's a hatchet.,0.0
"That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?",0.0
Because we've got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we've got to have a new direction for this country.,0.0
We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.,0.0
"Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.",0.0
I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.,0.0
I know how to eliminate programs.,0.0
"I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program.",0.0
Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.,0.0
I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.,0.0
I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.,0.0
I know how to save billions.,0.0
"I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.",0.0
"But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill.",0.0
... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown.,0.0
That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.,1.0
"Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.",0.0
It sounds good.,0.0
It's proposed periodically.,0.0
It doesn't happen.,0.0
"And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all.",0.0
There are some programs that are underfunded.,0.0
And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.,0.0
"Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks.",0.0
That's one of the centerpieces of his campaign.,0.0
"There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated.",1.0
But it's not going to solve the problem.,0.0
"Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward.",0.0
"When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion.",0.0
It has doubled over the last eight years.,0.0
And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.,0.0
So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit.,0.0
"And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.",0.0
"We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.",0.0
Sure I do.,0.0
"Senator Obama, I am not President Bush.",0.0
"If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.",0.0
I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.,0.0
Senator Obama talks about voting for budgets.,0.0
"He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year.",0.0
"Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.",0.0
It's completely out of control.,0.0
"The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City.",0.0
They're doing it all over America because they have to.,0.0
Because they have to balance their budgets.,0.0
I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...,0.0
... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.,0.0
"Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.",1.0
I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.,0.0
Senator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for.,0.0
He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.,0.0
He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed.,0.0
"So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama.",0.0
Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.,1.0
I have fought against spending.,0.0
I have fought against special interests.,0.0
I have fought for reform.,0.0
You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.,0.0
"Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it.",0.0
"First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.",0.0
I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers.,0.0
Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.,0.0
I support clean coal technology.,0.0
Doesn't make me popular with environmentalists.,0.0
So I've got a history of reaching across the aisle.,0.0
"Now with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.",0.0
"Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.",0.0
"So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.",1.0
"Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that.",0.0
"But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.",0.0
And it hasn't worked.,0.0
And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.,0.0
We need to move in a new direction.,0.0
But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration.,0.0
I have disagreed with leaders of my own party.,0.0
Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time.,0.0
"Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed.",0.0
Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.,0.0
Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.,0.0
I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.,0.0
"Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.",0.0
"Well, this has been a tough campaign.",1.0
It's been a very tough campaign.,1.0
"And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.",0.0
"When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, ""Any place, any time,"" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas.",0.0
So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.,0.0
"And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.",0.0
And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.,0.0
But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.,0.0
"One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.",0.0
"That, to me, was so hurtful.",1.0
"And, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks.",0.0
"Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them.",0.0
"I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.",0.0
"So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign.",0.0
This is a tough campaign.,0.0
And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.,0.0
And I can prove it.,0.0
"And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.",0.0
"And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't.",0.0
Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.,0.0
"Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough.",0.0
"I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.",0.0
"And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.",0.0
It absolutely is true.,0.0
"And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.",1.0
"And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.",0.0
That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.,0.0
"The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.",0.0
"What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.",0.0
And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.,0.0
"Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.",0.0
"And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.",0.0
And that is something that I would welcome.,0.0
"But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.",0.0
And any objective observer has said it's not true.,0.0
You're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research.,0.0
I don't.,0.0
You're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration.,0.0
"So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.",0.0
"And of course, I've been talking about the economy.",0.0
"Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around.",0.0
I'm going to let him keep his wealth.,0.0
"And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.",0.0
That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.,0.0
"But again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman...",0.0
"I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like ""terrorist"" and ""kill him,"" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say ""Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.""",0.0
And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.,0.0
... my response.,0.0
"I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate.",0.0
"And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.",0.0
"The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth.",0.0
"And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.",0.0
"But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues.",0.0
"Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples.",0.0
You know that.,0.0
And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.,0.0
"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens.",1.0
"And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.",0.0
"So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.",0.0
But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.,0.0
I haven't.,0.0
"Well, look, Bob, as I said...",0.0
"You know, here's what I would say.",0.0
"I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns.",0.0
I suspect we won't agree here tonight.,0.0
"What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together.",0.0
And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.,0.0
"And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.",0.0
"What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.",0.0
And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.,0.0
"But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.",0.0
"We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.",1.0
"The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for ""lighting and site selection.""",0.0
"So all of these things need to be examined, of course.",0.0
"Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.",0.0
"In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.",0.0
This has been their primary focus.,0.0
So let's get the record straight.,0.0
Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.,0.0
"Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.",0.0
I have roundly condemned those acts.,0.0
"Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.",0.0
"Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.",0.0
Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.,0.0
He has never been involved in this campaign.,0.0
And he will not advise me in the White House.,0.0
So that's Mr. Ayers.,0.0
"Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization.",0.0
"Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.",0.0
It had nothing to do with us.,0.0
We were not involved.,0.0
The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U. S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.,0.0
"Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.",0.0
Let me tell you who I associate with.,0.0
"On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.",0.0
"If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.",0.0
"Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.",0.0
"And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.",1.0
"Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.",0.0
So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.,0.0
That's absolutely not true.,0.0
And the facts are facts and records are records.,0.0
And that's not the facts.,0.0
"And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.",0.0
It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.,0.0
"And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America.",0.0
And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.,0.0
And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.,0.0
"Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country.",0.0
It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.,0.0
"And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.",0.0
"But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.",0.0
"And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.",0.0
That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.,1.0
"Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.",0.0
"Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.",0.0
"So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.",0.0
"Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.",0.0
They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.,0.0
She's a reformer.,0.0
She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor.,0.0
"When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, ""This can't go on.""",0.0
She's given money back to the taxpayers.,0.0
She's cut the size of government.,0.0
"She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.",0.0
She's a reformer through and through.,0.0
And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years.,1.0
She'll be my partner.,0.0
She understands reform.,0.0
"And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.",0.0
"She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.",0.0
She understands that better than almost any American that I know.,0.0
I'm proud of her.,0.0
And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process.,0.0
And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.,0.0
"Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.",0.0
"You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.",0.0
"I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.",0.0
And I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs.,0.0
"I agree with that, John.",0.0
"I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research.",0.0
That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.,0.0
"And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it.",0.0
"That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.",0.0
I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects.,0.0
"But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.",0.0
He voted against the first Gulf War.,0.0
"He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.",0.0
"In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.",1.0
"We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them.",0.0
We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.,0.0
"There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.",0.0
"But again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, ""We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the answer"" -- why do we always have to spend more?",0.0
"Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?",0.0
Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.,0.0
Climate change.,0.0
"I believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil.",0.0
Canadian oil is fine.,0.0
"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.""",0.0
You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.,0.0
"We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away.",0.0
We can store and we can reprocess.,0.0
"Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.",0.0
"Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them.",0.0
"I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela.",0.0
I think that's about a realistic timeframe.,0.0
And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.,0.0
"Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.",0.0
But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia.,0.0
It's mortgaging our children's future.,0.0
"Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.",0.0
"Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.",0.0
And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.,0.0
"But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.",0.0
"That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal.",0.0
"These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.",0.0
We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.,0.0
Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue.,0.0
I believe in free trade.,0.0
"But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.",0.0
And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.,0.0
And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.,0.0
In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.,0.0
"And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States.",0.0
That's all good.,0.0
"We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.",0.0
That is not free trade.,0.0
We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.,0.0
And you really have to pay attention to words.,0.0
"He said, we will look at offshore drilling.",0.0
Did you get that?,0.0
Look at.,0.0
We can offshore drill now.,0.0
We've got to do it now.,0.0
We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.,0.0
It's doable.,0.0
The technology is there and we have to drill now.,0.0
"Now, on the subject of free trade agreements.",0.0
I am a free trader.,0.0
But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.,0.0
"Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.",0.0
"Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.",0.0
The same country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that's killing young Americans.,0.0
And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid.,0.0
Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer.,0.0
But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.,0.0
Let me respond.,0.0
"Actually, I understand it pretty well.",0.0
The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.,0.0
"And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.",0.0
But I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.,0.0
"And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.",0.0
"When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now.",0.0
They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices.,0.0
"And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans.",0.0
"That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.",0.0
And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.,0.0
It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.,0.0
"If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.",0.0
"Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.",1.0
"Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.",0.0
So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.,0.0
"And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.",1.0
We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.,0.0
"We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.",0.0
"Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again.",0.0
"Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line.",0.0
"Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.",0.0
Neither of them have health insurance.,0.0
"And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.",0.0
So here's what my plan does.,0.0
"If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.",0.0
"If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.",0.0
The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.,0.0
"And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year.",0.0
"If you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.",0.0
We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.,0.0
We'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.,0.0
We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.,0.0
"And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented.",0.0
We've got to put more money into preventive care.,0.0
"This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget, because we can't afford these escalating costs.",0.0
"Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.",1.0
Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.,0.0
"And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country.",0.0
And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.,0.0
We need to put health care records online.,0.0
We need to have more community health centers.,0.0
We need to have walk-in clinics.,0.0
The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is.,0.0
We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools.,0.0
Every parent should know what's going on there.,0.0
We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.,0.0
"But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.",0.0
Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.,0.0
"Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.",0.0
"Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy.",0.0
"Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.",0.0
"If you like that, you'll love Canada and England.",0.0
So the point is...,0.0
I just...,0.0
Excuse me.,0.0
I just described what my plan is.,0.0
"And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.",0.0
Here's your fine -- zero.,0.0
"You won't pay a fine, because...",0.0
Zero?,0.0
"Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.",0.0
I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.,1.0
"But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice.",0.0
Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.,0.0
"Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.",0.0
The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.,0.0
So here's what we do.,0.0
We exempt small businesses.,0.0
"In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.",1.0
"If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.",0.0
"Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan.",0.0
"He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.",0.0
That sounds pretty good.,0.0
And you can go out and buy your own insurance.,0.0
"Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.",0.0
"This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.",0.0
"Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.",0.0
"And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.",0.0
"And this is your plan, John.",0.0
"For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.",0.0
"By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.",0.0
"So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.",0.0
"Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.",1.0
"That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.",1.0
"Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.",0.0
"Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.",1.0
That's big government at its best.,0.0
And the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America.,0.0
"The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800.",0.0
"I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.",0.0
This will give them availability.,0.0
"This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them.",0.0
This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.,0.0
Senator Obama wants government to do the job.,0.0
"I want, Joe, you to do the job.",0.0
I want to leave money in your pocket.,0.0
I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.,0.0
That's what I'm all about.,0.0
And we've got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.,0.0
"We can't afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse.",0.0
"Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.",0.0
Very briefly.,0.0
You all just heard my plan.,0.0
"If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.",0.0
"Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.",0.0
That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.,0.0
And don't take my word for it.,0.0
"All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs.",0.0
"That includes you, Joe.",0.0
I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.,0.0
That's not appropriate to do.,0.0
I thought it was a bad decision.,0.0
I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.,0.0
I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.,0.0
And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.,0.0
"Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up.",0.0
Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.,0.0
"We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats.",0.0
You were offered a chance to join.,0.0
"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges.""",0.0
I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.,0.0
"Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated.",0.0
This is a very important issue we're talking about.,0.0
Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards.,1.0
That's not the way we should judge these nominees.,1.0
Elections have consequences.,0.0
They should be judged on their qualifications.,0.0
And so that's what I will do.,0.0
I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution.,0.0
And not legislating from the bench.,0.0
I would consider anyone in their qualifications.,0.0
I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.,0.0
But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.,0.0
"Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.",0.0
"And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president.",0.0
It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.,0.0
Now I would not provide a litmus test.,0.0
I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.,0.0
"But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.",0.0
"And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.",0.0
So this is going to be an important issue.,0.0
"I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.",0.0
I'll just give you one quick example.,0.0
Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.,0.0
"For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.",0.0
"And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.",0.0
We tried to overturn it in the Senate.,0.0
I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.,0.0
"I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.",0.0
And that's the kind of judge that I want.,0.0
"Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.",0.0
It was a trial lawyer's dream.,0.0
Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.,0.0
We have to change the culture of America.,1.0
Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.,0.0
And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.,0.0
"Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion.",1.0
He voted against that.,1.0
"And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.",1.0
"Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.",1.0
"And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.",1.0
"I don't know how you vote ""present"" on some of that.",0.0
I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.,0.0
"And that's his record, and that's a matter of his record.",0.0
"And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.",0.0
"It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.",0.0
"Yes, let me respond to this.",0.0
"If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true.",0.0
The -- here are the facts.,0.0
There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.,0.0
"The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.",0.0
"And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it.",0.0
"Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.",0.0
"With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.",0.0
"And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional.",0.0
"And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.",0.0
The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.,0.0
"This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.",0.0
"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.""",0.0
"Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.",0.0
I think it's always a tragic situation.,1.0
We should try to reduce these circumstances.,0.0
"You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.",0.0
"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, ""health.""",0.0
"But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.",0.0
We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives.,0.0
We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.,0.0
But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.,0.0
"Of course, we have to come together.",0.0
"Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it.",0.0
"This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.",0.0
So we've got to get our education system right.,0.0
"Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.",0.0
"In some cases, we are going to have to invest.",0.0
"Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.",0.0
"I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.",0.0
And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.,0.0
"Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.",0.0
"And that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.",0.0
"If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.",0.0
"But there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents.",0.0
We can't do it just in the schools.,0.0
Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.,0.0
"They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.",0.0
"Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century.",0.0
There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.,0.0
But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?,0.0
"So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.",0.0
And we find bad teachers another line of work.,0.0
"And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.",0.0
"Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition.",0.0
They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.,0.0
"Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.",0.0
You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.,0.0
So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.,0.0
"We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.",0.0
"Look, we must improve education in this country.",0.0
"As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available.",0.0
We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.,0.0
We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.,0.0
"Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well.",0.0
But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.,0.0
He put forward No Child Left Behind.,0.0
"Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind.",0.0
"And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.",0.0
"So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.",0.0
Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.,0.0
"Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.",0.0
"And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.",0.0
Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.,0.0
And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.,0.0
"Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.",0.0
"I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.",0.0
And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.,0.0
We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.,0.0
"And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.",0.0
It's not going to happen on its own.,0.0
"Well, sure.",0.0
Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.,0.0
And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.,0.0
"And we all know the state of the Washington, D. C., school system.",0.0
That was vouchers.,0.0
"That was vouchers, Senator Obama.",0.0
And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.,0.0
"Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.",0.0
"It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective.",0.0
And we need to fix a lot of the problems.,0.0
We need to sit down and reauthorize it.,0.0
"But, again, spending more money isn't always the answer.",0.0
I think the Head Start program is a great program.,0.0
"A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.",0.0
By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.,0.0
Let's reform it.,0.0
Let's reform it and fund it.,0.0
"That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats.",0.0
We need to reform these programs.,0.0
We need to have transparency.,0.0
We need to have rewards.,0.0
It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.,0.0
"And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism.",0.0
Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.,0.0
"And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.",0.0
And we'll care for these young children.,0.0
And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.,0.0
"But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.",0.0
"And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed.",0.0
But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.,0.0
"And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.",0.0
"She supports vouchers, also.",0.0
That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.,0.0
"So if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on.",0.0
And that's what I intend to do as president.,0.0
"Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn't do it, even though it's working.",0.0
I got it.,0.0
"Well, thank you again, Bob.",0.0
Thanks to Hofstra.,0.0
And it's great to be with you again.,0.0
I think we've had a very healthy discussion.,1.0
"My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.",0.0
And they were graphically demonstrated again today.,0.0
America needs a new direction.,1.0
We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.,0.0
"I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.",0.0
And I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars.,0.0
We have to make health care affordable and available.,0.0
"We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.",0.0
We have to stop the spending.,0.0
"We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures.",0.0
"All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.",1.0
"That's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.",0.0
I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first.,0.0
And I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again.,0.0
I'd be honored and humbled.,0.0
"Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.",0.0
I think we all know America is going through tough times right now.,1.0
The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.,1.0
And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.,0.0
"We need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring.",0.0
You've shared your stories with me.,0.0
And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.,0.0
And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.,1.0
"But we're going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go.",0.0
In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.,0.0
In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.,0.0
These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.,0.0
And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.,0.0
But it's not going to be easy.,0.0
It's not going to be quick.,0.0
"It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.",0.0
I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.,0.0
"I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.",1.0
Thank you very much.,0.0
"Thank you, Jeremy.",0.0
"I appreciate your -- your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time.",0.0
Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this -- this event.,0.0
"Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate.",0.0
Your question -- your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country.,0.0
"I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia -- and she said, ""I've got my degree.",0.0
I can't find a job.,0.0
I've got three part- time jobs.,0.0
They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.,0.0
"I can't begin to pay back my student loans.""",0.0
So what we have to do is two things.,0.0
We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.,0.0
"And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.",0.0
"When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam.",0.0
"If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it's a public institution.",0.0
I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing.,0.0
"We're also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school.",0.0
But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.,0.0
"And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people.",0.0
I want you to be able to get a job.,0.0
I know what it takes to get this economy going.,0.0
"With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.",0.0
"And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.",0.0
And likewise you've got more and more debt on your back.,0.0
So more debt and less jobs.,0.0
I'm going to change that.,0.0
I know what it takes to create good jobs again.,0.0
I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.,0.0
"And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.",0.0
It's not going to be like the last four years.,0.0
"The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce.",0.0
"I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate -- when do you graduate?",0.0
2014.,0.0
"When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president.",0.0
I'm going to make sure you get a job.,0.0
Thanks Jeremy.,0.0
"Yeah, you bet.",0.0
"Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright.",0.0
And the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical.,0.0
"Not just to you, but to the entire nation.",0.0
"Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country.",0.0
"But not just jobs, good paying jobs.",0.0
Ones that can support a family.,0.0
"And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.",0.0
And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.,0.0
"Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again.",0.0
Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.,0.0
I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.,0.0
"I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.",0.0
It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.,0.0
"Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.",0.0
"And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future.",0.0
"Number three, we've got to control our own energy.",0.0
"Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now.",0.0
"That's why we've invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars.",0.0
"We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way.",0.0
Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.,0.0
"And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.",1.0
"We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well.",1.0
Well what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job.,0.0
"And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.",0.0
The president's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven't put Americans back to work.,0.0
We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office.,0.0
"But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.",0.0
We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.,0.0
That's why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.,0.0
It's going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.,0.0
It's going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.,0.0
"And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.",0.0
And that's right.,0.0
My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger.,0.0
"And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.",0.0
"Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt.",0.0
You took General Motors bankrupt.,0.0
You took Chrysler bankrupt.,0.0
"So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.",0.0
"And I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people.",0.0
That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.,0.0
"Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.",0.0
He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open.,0.0
And we would have lost a million jobs.,0.0
"And that -- don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney.",0.0
But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.,0.0
And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?,1.0
Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan.,1.0
He has a one-point plan.,1.0
And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.,1.0
"That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.",1.0
You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.,0.0
You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.,0.0
"You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money.",0.0
That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.,0.0
That's what's been squeezing middle class families.,0.0
And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.,0.0
The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.,0.0
... that Detroit answer...,0.0
You're doing great.,0.0
Thank you very much.,0.0
"And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes.",0.0
And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.,0.0
"You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.",0.0
"Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.",0.0
Food prices up.,0.0
Utility prices up.,0.0
The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.,0.0
So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.,0.0
That's part -- that's part one.,0.0
"Now, how about deductions?",0.0
"'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.",0.0
The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.,0.0
So that'll stay the same.,0.0
Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.,0.0
"And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.",0.0
"Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.",0.0
"But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.",0.0
No tax on your savings.,0.0
That makes life a lot easier.,0.0
"If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.",0.0
Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?,0.0
"Because under the last four years, they've been buried.",0.0
And I want to help people in the middle-class.,0.0
"And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.",0.0
"And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.",0.0
Not just at the high end.,0.0
"A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.",0.0
I will not let that happen.,0.0
"I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families.",0.0
And what's that going to do?,0.0
"It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.",0.0
My philosophy on taxes has been simple.,0.0
Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.,0.0
"Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.",0.0
So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.,0.0
"Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00.",0.0
"I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth.",0.0
And we've cut them 18 times.,0.0
"And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.",0.0
"But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.",0.0
"So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.",0.0
"And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.",0.0
I'm ready to sign that bill right now.,0.0
The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.,0.0
"But what I've also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.",0.0
We created 23 million new jobs.,0.0
That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.,0.0
It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.,0.0
"Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.",0.0
"He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?",0.0
"And he said, ""Yes, I think that's fair.""",0.0
"Not only that, he said, ""I think that's what grows the economy.""",0.0
"Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.",0.0
I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.,0.0
I think that grows the economy.,0.0
I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.,0.0
That grows our economy.,0.0
So we just have a different theory.,0.0
"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said ""I'm going to give tax cuts"" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said ""tax cuts to everybody,"" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history.",0.0
And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.,0.0
You heard what I said about my tax plan.,0.0
I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.,0.0
I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.,0.0
"And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?",0.0
"Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.",0.0
"And for me, this is about jobs.",0.0
I want to get America's economy going again.,1.0
"So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.",0.0
"For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.",0.0
We can do better than this.,0.0
"We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.",0.0
There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.,0.0
We don't have to live like this.,0.0
We can get this economy going again.,0.0
My five-point plan does it.,0.0
Energy independence for North America in five years.,0.0
"Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.",0.0
Cracking down on China when they cheat.,0.0
Getting us to a balanced budget.,0.0
Fixing our training programs for our workers.,0.0
"And finally, championing small business.",0.0
I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.,0.0
I know how to make that happen.,0.0
I spent my life in the private sector.,0.0
I know why jobs come and why they go.,0.0
And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.,0.0
"No, it's not settled.",0.0
Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.,0.0
That's $7 trillion.,0.0
He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.,0.0
That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.,0.0
"Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.",0.0
"But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?",0.0
We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.,0.0
"Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.",0.0
"If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up.",1.0
"And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.",0.0
"Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.",0.0
You're going to be paying for it.,0.0
"Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.",0.0
"I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.",0.0
I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.,0.0
"I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.",0.0
"When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?",0.0
That's math that doesn't add up.,0.0
We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.,0.0
"And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.",0.0
Instead he's doubled it.,0.0
"We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.",0.0
"If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.",0.0
This puts us on a road to Greece.,0.0
I know what it takes to balance budgets.,0.0
I've done it my entire life.,0.0
"Well, no it's not.",0.0
And...,0.0
"And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you.",0.0
"Well, Katherine, that's a great question.",0.0
"And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids.",0.0
And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.,0.0
"My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank.",0.0
"She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip.",0.0
"And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.",0.0
She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.,0.0
She didn't complain.,0.0
That's not what you did in that generation.,0.0
And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.,0.0
"And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it.",0.0
So we fixed that.,0.0
"And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.",0.0
"This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.",1.0
It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.,0.0
"Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.",0.0
"Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.",0.0
"We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.",0.0
"We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.",0.0
Let's give the money directly to students.,0.0
"And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.",0.0
"But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.",0.0
That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.,0.0
I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.,0.0
Thank you.,0.0
"And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.",0.0
"And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, ""How come all the people for these jobs are -- are all men.""",0.0
"They said, ""Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.""",0.0
"And I said, ""Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified? """,0.0
And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.,0.0
"I went to a number of women's groups and said, ""Can you help us find folks,"" and they brought us whole binders full of women.",0.0
"I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.",0.0
Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.,0.0
"My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.",0.0
"She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night.",0.0
I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.,0.0
So we said fine.,0.0
Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.,0.0
"We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.",0.0
That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.,0.0
"We're still down 580,000 jobs.",0.0
"I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago.",0.0
"What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.",0.0
This is what I have done.,0.0
"It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.",0.0
And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.,0.0
An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.,0.0
"An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have.",0.0
I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.,0.0
"He said, ""I'll get back to you.""",1.0
And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.,1.0
"Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.",0.0
"For example, their healthcare.",0.0
You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.,0.0
I think that's a mistake.,0.0
It makes a difference.,0.0
This is money out of that family's pocket.,0.0
"Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.",0.0
That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.,0.0
"When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.",0.0
That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.,0.0
And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.,0.0
"When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.",0.0
These are not just women's issues.,0.0
These are family issues.,0.0
These are economic issues.,0.0
And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.,0.0
That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.,0.0
And I appreciate that question.,0.0
"I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...",0.0
"I don't think so, Candy.",0.0
I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.,0.0
I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.,0.0
And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.,0.0
Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.,0.0
And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.,0.0
President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.,0.0
"I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.",0.0
"That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.",0.0
"Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.",0.0
I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.,0.0
It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.,0.0
I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.,0.0
"Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.",0.0
President Bush didn't.,0.0
"President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.",1.0
"He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.",0.0
"And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.",0.0
So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.,0.0
"And then let's take the last one, championing small business.",0.0
I came through small business.,0.0
I understand how hard it is to start a small business.,0.0
That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.,0.0
I want to keep their taxes down on small business.,0.0
"I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.",0.0
"And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.",0.0
My priority is jobs.,0.0
And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.,0.0
My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.,0.0
"Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.",0.0
"We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.",0.0
But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.,0.0
"Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.",0.0
And the plans that I talked about will create even more.,0.0
"But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.",0.0
That's what took us from surplus to deficit.,0.0
"When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.",0.0
"That's -- Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.",0.0
"And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.",0.0
We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.,0.0
"When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.",0.0
And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.,0.0
But the last point I want to make is this.,0.0
"You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.",0.0
George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.,0.0
George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.,0.0
He didn't call for self-deportation.,0.0
"George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.",0.0
"In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.",0.0
And I think that's a mistake.,0.0
That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.,0.0
"Well, we've gone through a tough four years.",0.0
There's no doubt about it.,0.0
"But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families.",0.0
"I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.",0.0
"I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did.",0.0
"I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.",0.0
"I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have.",0.0
"I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.",0.0
"We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.",0.0
We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.,0.0
"Now, does that mean you're not struggling?",0.0
Absolutely not.,0.0
A lot of us are.,0.0
"And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.",1.0
"All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept.",0.0
"And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.",0.0
"But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well.",0.0
And I suspect he'll keep those too.,0.0
"You know when members of the Republican Congress say, ""We're going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don't ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college.",0.0
"When they said, ""We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding.""",0.0
"He said, ""Me too.""",0.0
"When he said, ""We're going to repeal Obamacare.",0.0
"First thing I'm going to do,"" despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well.",0.0
"That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he's going to keep.",0.0
Make sure your kids can go to college.,0.0
Governor?,0.0
I think you know better.,0.0
I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.,0.0
"I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.",0.0
You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.,0.0
We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.,0.0
He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.,0.0
The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.,0.0
I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent.,0.0
This was the president's plan.,0.0
Didn't get there.,0.0
"He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.",0.0
He would reform them.,0.0
He'd get that done.,0.0
He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.,0.0
He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.,0.0
Didn't even file it.,0.0
This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.,0.0
He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.,0.0
He hasn't done that either.,0.0
"In fact, he doubled it.",0.0
"He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year.",0.0
"It's gone up by $2,500 a year.",0.0
"And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented -- it's already been passed -- if it's implemented fully, it'll be another $2,500 on top.",0.0
The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.,0.0
"He keeps saying, ""Look, I've created 5 million jobs.""",0.0
That's after losing 5 million jobs.,0.0
The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.,0.0
"The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.",0.0
"There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.",0.0
How about food stamps?,0.0
"When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps.",0.0
"Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.",0.0
How about the growth of the economy?,0.0
"It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.",0.0
The president wants to do well.,0.0
I understand.,0.0
"You might say, ""Well, you got an example of one that worked better? """,0.0
"Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery.",0.0
Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.,1.0
And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.,1.0
"The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked.",1.0
"That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at.",0.0
"And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.",0.0
That's what this election is about.,0.0
It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.,0.0
This is for Governor Romney?,0.0
Lorraine.,0.0
Lorraine?,0.0
"Good, thanks.",0.0
Did I get that right?,0.0
Good.,0.0
Thank you for your question.,0.0
And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.,0.0
"But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.",1.0
We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.,1.0
My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.,0.0
We welcome legal immigrants into this country.,0.0
I want our legal system to work better.,0.0
I want it to be streamlined.,0.0
I want it to be clearer.,0.0
I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.,0.0
"I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need.",0.0
"People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U. S. of A.",0.0
We should make sure our legal system works.,0.0
"Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration.",0.0
There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.,0.0
Those who've come here illegally take their place.,0.0
So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.,0.0
What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.,0.0
I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.,0.0
"So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would.",0.0
"The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.",0.0
"Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration.",0.0
He didn't do it.,0.0
"He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses.",0.0
Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?,0.0
What's a question I think the -- the president will have a chance to answer right now.,0.0
"Good, I look forward to it.",0.0
Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.,0.0
I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.,0.0
We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.,0.0
But we're also a nation of laws.,0.0
So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.,0.0
"The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth.",0.0
They'll start new businesses.,0.0
They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.,0.0
"Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.",0.0
"What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.",0.0
And that's what we've done.,0.0
Think of this as their country.,0.0
Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.,0.0
And that's what I've done administratively.,0.0
"Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, ""I will veto the DREAM Act"", that would allow these young people to have access.""",0.0
"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, ""We're going to encourage self-deportation.""",0.0
Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.,0.0
He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.,0.0
Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.,0.0
You know what?,0.0
"If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.",0.0
"So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way.",0.0
"And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, ""Well Obama didn't try.""",0.0
That's not true.,0.0
"And I said, let's fix this system.",0.0
Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.,0.0
"But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting.",0.0
"No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.",0.0
I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.,0.0
"I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation.",0.0
That's number one.,0.0
"Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.",0.0
He was asked this on Univision the other day.,0.0
"Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?",0.0
And he didn't answer.,0.0
He -- he doesn't answer that question.,0.0
He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.,0.0
"I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.",0.0
Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.,0.0
"In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.",0.0
I was not the standard bearer.,0.0
My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.,0.0
"Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.",0.0
"What I was saying is, we're not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.",0.0
Instead let people make their own choice.,0.0
"And if they -- if they find that -- that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't -- and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where -- where they have better opportunities.",0.0
But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and -- and -- and taking them out of this country.,0.0
"I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country.",0.0
Let me mention something else the president said.,0.0
"It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth.",0.0
Hold on a second.,0.0
Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.,0.0
"And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in -- in Chinese companies.",0.0
"Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?",0.0
Have you looked at your pension?,0.0
"You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.",0.0
It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.,0.0
"Well, let me give you some advice.",0.0
I don't check it that often.,0.0
Let me give you some advice.,0.0
Look at your pension.,0.0
You also have investments in Chinese companies.,0.0
You also have investments outside the United States.,0.0
You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.,0.0
I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.,0.0
Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.,0.0
"His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.",0.0
That's his policy.,0.0
And it's a bad policy.,0.0
And it won't help us grow.,0.0
"Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.",0.0
And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.,0.0
And we want to encourage that.,0.0
"Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better.",0.0
"But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't...",0.0
I'll get it done.,0.0
And it's time for them to get serious on it.,0.0
This used to be a bipartisan issue.,0.0
"OK. Hi, Kerry.",0.0
I'm sorry.,0.0
What's your name?,0.0
Great to see you.,0.0
"Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.",0.0
"And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.",0.0
"I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.",0.0
I know these folks and I know their families.,0.0
So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.,0.0
"So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.",0.0
"Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region.",0.0
"Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again.",0.0
"And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.",0.0
Now Governor Romney had a very different response.,0.0
"While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates.",0.0
You don't turn national security into a political issue.,0.0
Certainly not right when it's happening.,0.0
And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.,0.0
"But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.",0.0
"I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.",0.0
"I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.",0.0
"I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.",0.0
"And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.",0.0
"And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home.",0.0
You know that I mean what I say.,0.0
"Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one.",0.0
"And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.",1.0
I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.,0.0
And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.,0.0
We -- we think of their families and care for them deeply.,0.0
There were other issues associated with this -- with this tragedy.,0.0
"There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.",0.0
And there was no demonstration involved.,0.0
It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.,0.0
"Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration.",0.0
How could we have not known?,0.0
"But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.",0.0
I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.,0.0
We've read their accounts now about what happened.,0.0
It was very clear this was not a demonstration.,0.0
This was an attack by terrorists.,0.0
And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.,0.0
"Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.",0.0
"Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.",0.0
We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.,0.0
"Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America.",0.0
"The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.",0.0
Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.,0.0
But she works for me.,0.0
"I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.",0.0
That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.,0.0
"And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.",0.0
That's not what we do.,0.0
"That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.",0.0
"You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.",0.0
"It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?",0.0
Please proceed governor.,0.0
I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.,0.0
Get the transcript.,0.0
It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.,0.0
Excuse me.,0.0
"We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.",0.0
We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.,0.0
"But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.",0.0
"You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.",1.0
And her son had been shot through the head.,1.0
"And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.",0.0
But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.,1.0
"So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.",0.0
But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.,0.0
And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.,0.0
Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.,0.0
But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.,0.0
"And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.",0.0
And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.,0.0
Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.,0.0
But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.,0.0
"Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.",0.0
"We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.",0.0
"What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.",0.0
And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?,0.0
And there are a number of things.,0.0
He mentioned good schools.,0.0
I totally agree.,0.0
We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.,0.0
"And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.",0.0
But let me mention another thing.,0.0
And that is parents.,0.0
"Wherever possible the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that's not always possible.",0.0
"A lot of great single moms, single dads.",0.0
"But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.",0.0
"Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically.",0.0
The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.,0.0
"So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system.",0.0
They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.,0.0
"For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.",0.0
But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.,0.0
"I'd like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords.",0.0
"Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation.",0.0
"And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.",0.0
"There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven't previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation.",0.0
"That's what we need more of, Candy.",0.0
What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.,0.0
-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.,0.0
I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.,0.0
"The -- first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.",0.0
"And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.",0.0
So that's on the record.,0.0
"But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.",0.0
We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.,0.0
"But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed.",0.0
"And, Candy, we haven't had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we've put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed.",0.0
We're starting to see gains in math and science.,0.0
"When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now.",0.0
"And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.",0.0
And so we're matching them up.,0.0
Giving them access to higher education.,0.0
"As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before.",0.0
This is part of the choice in this election.,0.0
"When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers, hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn't grow our economy.",0.0
But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people...,0.0
... and reduce our violence.,0.0
OK.,0.0
"Boy, great question and important question, because you're absolutely right.",0.0
The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.,0.0
China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.,0.0
It used to be the United States of America.,0.0
A lot of good people have lost jobs.,0.0
A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.,0.0
That's total over the last four years.,0.0
One of the reasons for that is that people think it's more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.,0.0
We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.,0.0
What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.,1.0
This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.,0.0
"It's not by trickle-down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations.",0.0
"Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere.",0.0
"I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America.",1.0
"Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules.",0.0
And China hasn't.,0.0
One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.,0.0
"Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low.",0.0
And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.,0.0
We lose sales.,0.0
And manufacturers here in the U. S. making the same products can't compete.,0.0
China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.,0.0
"And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so.",0.0
"On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.",0.0
So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.,0.0
But let me -- let me not just stop there.,0.0
"Don't forget, what's key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I'm going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they -- they follow the law and play by the rules, but it's also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds.",0.0
"That's why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here.",0.0
Canada's tax rate on companies is now 15 percent.,0.0
Ours is 35 percent.,0.0
"So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it?",0.0
We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.,0.0
Regulations have quadrupled.,0.0
The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.,0.0
I talk to small businesses across the country.,0.0
"They say, ""We feel like we're under attack from our own government.""",0.0
"I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it.",0.0
And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.,0.0
My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.,0.0
"If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.",0.0
The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high.,0.0
"I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.",0.0
OK. We need to create jobs here.,0.0
And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.,0.0
It's too high.,0.0
But there's a difference in terms of how we would do it.,0.0
"I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.",0.0
All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.,0.0
"Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.",0.0
"One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U. S. taxes.",0.0
"But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about.",0.0
"And it's estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs.",0.0
The problem is they'll be in china.,0.0
Or India.,0.0
Or Germany.,0.0
That's not the way we're going to create jobs here.,0.0
"The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports.",0.0
"And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president.",0.0
That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.,0.0
"That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal.",0.0
"Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated.",0.0
"In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing.",0.0
That's not my phrase.,0.0
That's what reporters called it.,0.0
"And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I've been president because we have pushed them hard.",0.0
And we've put unprecedented trade pressure on China.,0.0
That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.,0.0
That's going to help to create jobs here.,0.0
The answer is very straightforward.,0.0
We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.,0.0
China's been cheating over the years.,0.0
One by holding down the value of their currency.,0.0
"Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology.",0.0
"There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods.",0.0
They hack into our computers.,0.0
"We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one.",0.0
"Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business.",0.0
That's what brings jobs in.,0.0
"I want high wage, high skill jobs.",0.0
That's why we have to emphasize manufacturing.,0.0
That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.,0.0
That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.,0.0
"And when we talk about deficits, if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race.",0.0
If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.,0.0
Then companies won't come here.,0.0
"Those investments are what's going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now.",0.0
Government does not create jobs.,0.0

"Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer.",0.0

"Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II.",0.0
That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO.,0.0
I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.,0.0
It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.,0.0
And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.,0.0
We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.,0.0
Yes.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans.",0.0
I resent that comment.,1.0
"I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.",0.0
I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.,0.0
I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.,0.0
There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.,0.0
I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.,0.0
But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.,0.0
We had a war when we came into power in 1953.,0.0
We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy.,0.0
"We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.",0.0
"As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.",0.0
Mr.,0.0
"Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.",0.0
"I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.",0.0
"But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.",0.0
"I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war.",0.0
This is the history of dealing with dictators.,1.0
This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.,0.0
We tried this with Hitler.,0.0
It didn't work.,0.0
"He wanted first uh - we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted.",0.0
Now what do the Chinese Communists want?,1.0
They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.,1.0
"And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them.",0.0
"It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?",0.0
"I've often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them?",0.0
"And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.",0.0
The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.,0.0
"The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China.",0.0
"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U. S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu.""",0.0
"Now, that is the issue.",0.0
I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.,0.0
I support it and the Pescadores Island.,0.0
That is the present American position.,0.0
The treaty does not include these two islands.,0.0
Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.,0.0
"I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.",0.0
"Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.",0.0
"Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.",0.0
The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.,0.0
They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.,0.0
We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.,0.0
"This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.",0.0
"Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended.",0.0
"There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.",0.0
"Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question.",1.0
"As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.",1.0
"Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again.",0.0
"So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.",0.0
What do we do then?,0.0
"My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.",1.0
We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.,1.0
"We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.",1.0
"That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.",0.0
"And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.",0.0
The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.,0.0
"And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable.",0.0
The road to war is always paved with good intentions.,0.0
"And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.",0.0
But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.,0.0
I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did.,1.0
"In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: ""The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area.""",0.0
That was done with much thought and deliberation.,0.0
"Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.",0.0
I completely sustained the treaty.,0.0
I voted for it.,0.0
"I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island.",0.0
"What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area.",0.0
I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments.,0.0
Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford.,1.0
"General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: ""To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take.",1.0
"To me that concept is completely repugnant.""",1.0
So I stand with them.,1.0
"I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.",1.0
"I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.",0.0
But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty.,0.0
"Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.",1.0
"Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made.",0.0
Uh - I obviously don't think it's valid.,0.0
I have supported the Administration's position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct.,0.0
"As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination.",0.0
"Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.",1.0
"Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.",0.0
I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.,0.0
"I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.",0.0
"I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.",0.0
"And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.",0.0
The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.,0.0
What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.,0.0
"Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.",0.0
"Now, why did they reject it?",0.0
"For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.",0.0
Why?,0.0
Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.,0.0
"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina.""",0.0
The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.,0.0
"Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights.",0.0
I thought the.,0.0
"U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.",1.0
"I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however.",0.0
I never suggested espionage should stop.,0.0
"It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.",0.0
"Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.",0.0
"Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.",0.0
That's not the position he's taking.,0.0
"He's indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom.",0.0
He didn't take that position on Tibet.,0.0
He didn't take that position on Budapest.,0.0
He doesn't take that position that I've seen so far in Laos.,0.0
Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.,0.0
I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.,0.0
"But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.",1.0
"And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.",0.0
He's extending the Administration's commitment.,0.0
"Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.",0.0
"I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.",1.0
That's absurd.,1.0
"I don't suggest that, I don't support it.",0.0
I would disagree with it.,0.0
"Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it.",1.0
And that's my view now.,0.0
I disapprove of the issue.,0.0
I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.,0.0
Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.,0.0
"On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce.",0.0
We can't settle for anything but the best.,0.0
"And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce.",0.0
And that means that we can't have any test of religion.,0.0
We can't have any test of race.,0.0
It must be a test of a man.,0.0
Also as far as religion is concerned.,0.0
I have seen Communism abroad.,0.0
I see what it does.,0.0
Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.,1.0
We must not be divided on this issue.,0.0
The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.,1.0
"I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.",1.0
We cannot have it in our hearts.,0.0
But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.,0.0
"Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.",0.0
"Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.",0.0
"Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.",0.0
"He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.",0.0
"I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.",0.0
I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.,0.0
"I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.",1.0
"I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes.",0.0
One last point I should make.,0.0
The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.,0.0
"We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal.",0.0
"And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better.",0.0
"Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.",1.0
We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.,0.0
"Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President.",0.0
I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes.,0.0
"I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958.",0.0
I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.,0.0
I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.,0.0
"I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.",0.0
One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.,0.0
There might be others.,0.0
"By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.",0.0
The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.,0.0
He can set up a fact-finding committee.,0.0
The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.,0.0
"He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.",0.0
This is a difficult and sensitive matter.,1.0
"But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.",0.0
"He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.",0.0
"Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.",0.0
"The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.",0.0
"On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.",1.0
"My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history.",0.0
We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.,0.0
"Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.",0.0
"I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.",0.0
"Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.",0.0
"Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.",0.0
It is actuarially sound.,1.0
"So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.",0.0
"But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.",0.0
"Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.",1.0
Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures.,0.0
"I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.",0.0
"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't.""",0.0
"Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security.",0.0
But Social Security is a tax.,0.0
The people pay it.,0.0
It comes right out of your paycheck.,0.0
This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.,0.0
He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.,0.0
Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?,0.0
I don't think we should have that kind of a program.,0.0
Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.,1.0
"Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.",1.0
We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.,1.0
"I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.",1.0
"Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.",0.0
"I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.",0.0
"Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.",0.0
Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.,0.0
"It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.",0.0
"Now, what do we do about it?",0.0
"And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.",0.0
So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.,0.0
"In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.",0.0
"I refer, for example, to distressed areas.",0.0
We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.,0.0
We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.,1.0
"That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.",0.0
"And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.",0.0
"Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still.",0.0
Let's get that straight.,0.0
Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.,0.0
He's been traveling in some other country.,0.0
We have been moving.,0.0
We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years.,0.0
"But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.",0.0
"Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent.",0.0
That's untrue.,0.0
The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.,0.0
The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.,0.0
"And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.",0.0
But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.,0.0
The Vice President suggested a number of things.,0.0
He suggested that we aid distressed areas.,0.0
The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice.,0.0
He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.,0.0
But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.,0.0
"And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.",0.0
This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.,0.0
That's why we don't have full employment today.,0.0
"Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.",0.0
I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.,0.0
That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.,0.0
We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.,0.0
It includes oil abroad.,0.0
Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.,0.0
Now the oil industry recently has had hard times.,0.0
Particularly some of the smaller producers.,0.0
They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.,0.0
"But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.",0.0
"And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.",0.0
"I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.",0.0
I favor the present depletion allowance.,0.0
"I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.",0.0
Why do we have a depletion allowance?,0.0
"Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.",0.0
"If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.",1.0
"Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.",0.0
"And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.",0.0
And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.,0.0
One other thing.,0.0
He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.,0.0
"He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.",0.0
"I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.",0.0
But I oppose it.,0.0
I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.,0.0
I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.,0.0
"Well, Mr.",0.0
"Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.",0.0
"That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.",1.0
"Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.",0.0
And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce.,0.0
This one must be stepped up.,0.0
"Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.",1.0
Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.,1.0
I think we have been right in carrying it.,0.0
I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.,0.0
"But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.",0.0
They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.,0.0
"That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.",0.0
The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.,1.0
"We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.",0.0
"Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.",0.0
What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.,0.0
"If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.",0.0
"The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.",0.0
"In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.",0.0
"We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.",0.0
We have to be able to compete in the world market.,0.0
We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.,0.0
"In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.",0.0
"Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.",0.0
I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.,0.0
We have to be sure to maintain that.,0.0
"We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.",0.0
"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.",0.0
The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.,0.0
"Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.",0.0
"First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.",0.0
"That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.",1.0
I want us to invest in you.,1.0
I want us to invest in your future.,1.0
"That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.",0.0
We also have to make the economy fairer.,0.0
"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.",0.0
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.,0.0
"If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.",0.0
And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.,0.0
I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.,1.0
"So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.",0.0
Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.,0.0
How are we going to do it?,0.0
We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.,0.0
"Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.",0.0
We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.,0.0
"You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.",0.0
I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.,0.0
"Thank you, Lester.",0.0
Our jobs are fleeing the country.,0.0
They're going to Mexico.,0.0
They're going to many other countries.,0.0
You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.,0.0
"They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.",0.0
And we have a very good fight.,0.0
And we have a winning fight.,0.0
"Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.",0.0
"So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.",0.0
"When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.",1.0
"They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.",1.0
"With the United States, as he said, not so much.",1.0
So Ford is leaving.,1.0
"You see that, their small car division leaving.",0.0
"Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.",0.0
They're all leaving.,0.0
And we can't allow it to happen anymore.,0.0
"As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.",0.0
"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.",0.0
But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.,1.0
"We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.",0.0
All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.,0.0
"They left—fired 1,400 people.",0.0
So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.,0.0
We cannot let it happen.,0.0
"Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.",1.0
That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.,0.0
It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.,1.0
Companies will come.,1.0
They will build.,0.0
They will expand.,0.0
New companies will start.,0.0
"And I look very, very much forward to doing it.",0.0
"We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",1.0
"Well, I think that trade is an important issue.",0.0
"Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.",0.0
"And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.",0.0
"We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.",0.0
And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.,0.0
"In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.",0.0
"I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.",1.0
That is not how we grow the economy.,0.0
"We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.",0.0
I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.,0.0
I understand that.,0.0
"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.",1.0
"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.",1.0
I don't buy that.,1.0
I have a different experience.,0.0
My father was a small-businessman.,0.0
He worked really hard.,0.0
"He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.",0.0
"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.",0.0
That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.,0.0
"Well, for one thing—and before we start on that—my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.",1.0
Our country's in deep trouble.,1.0
"We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.",0.0
"They're the best, the best ever at it.",0.0
"What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.",1.0
So we have to do that.,1.0
We have to renegotiate our trade deals.,0.0
Let me give you the example of Mexico.,0.0
They have a VAT tax.,0.0
We're on a different system.,0.0
"When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.",0.0
"When they sell in—automatic, 16 percent, approximately.",0.0
"When they sell into us, there's no tax.",0.0
It's a defective agreement.,0.0
"It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.",0.0
"Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton—yes, is that OK?",0.0
Good.,0.0
I want you to be very happy.,0.0
It's very important to me.,0.0
"But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.",0.0
She's been doing this for 30 years.,0.0
And why hasn't she made the agreements better?,0.0
The NAFTA agreement is defective.,0.0
They should have been doing this for years.,1.0
"What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look, we owe $20 trillion.",0.0
"We cannot do it any longer, Lester.",0.0
"Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.",0.0
The companies are leaving.,0.0
"I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.",0.0
"They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.",0.0
"And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.",0.0
We wish you a lot of luck.,0.0
"But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.",0.0
"And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.",0.0
"So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.",0.0
We have to stop them from leaving.,0.0
"And that's a big, big factor.",0.0
"Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.",0.0
"We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.",0.0
"That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.",1.0
"In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.",1.0
"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.""",0.0
"Well, it did collapse.",0.0
"That's called business, by the way.",0.0
Nine million people—nine million people lost their jobs.,0.0
Five million people lost their homes.,0.0
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,0.0
"Now, we have come back from that abyss.",0.0
And it has not been easy.,0.0
"So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.",0.0
"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.",0.0
"They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.",0.0
Take clean energy.,0.0
Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.,0.0
Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,0.0
I think it's real.,0.0
I did not.,0.0
I think science is real.,0.0
I do not say that.,0.0
"And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.",0.0
And here's what we can do.,0.0
We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.,0.0
We can have enough clean energy to power every home.,0.0
We can build a new modern electric grid.,0.0
That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.,0.0
"So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",0.0
She talks about solar panels.,0.0
"We invested in a solar company, our country.",0.0
That was a disaster.,0.0
They lost plenty of money on that one.,0.0
"Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.",0.0
Our energy policies are a disaster.,0.0
"Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.",0.0
You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.,1.0
"The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.",1.0
"He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.",1.0
So I will tell you this.,1.0
We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.,0.0
"And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.",0.0
"And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.",0.0
"And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.",0.0
You've been doing this for 30 years.,0.0
Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?,0.0
"For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.",0.0
I will bring back jobs.,0.0
You can't bring back jobs.,0.0
"Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.",0.0
"Yeah, for 30 years.",0.0
"And I have—well, not quite that long.",0.0
I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.,0.0
Incomes went up for everybody.,0.0
"Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.",0.0
"When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.",0.0
Will they create jobs in America?,0.0
Will they raise incomes in America?,0.0
And are they good for our national security?,0.0
Some of them I voted for.,0.0
"The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.",0.0
And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.,0.0
But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.,0.0
"I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.",0.0
I'm going to have a special prosecutor.,0.0
"We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.",0.0
"When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.",0.0
We increased them to China 50 percent.,0.0
So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.,0.0
You haven't done it.,0.0
"NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.",0.0
And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0.0
You were totally in favor of it.,0.0
"Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.",0.0
"But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.",0.0
Nothing will ever top NAFTA.,0.0
I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.,0.0
You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.,0.0
"And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.",0.0
"Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.",1.0
Is it President Obama's fault?,0.0
"There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.",0.0
And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.,0.0
"That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.",0.0
But you have no plan.,0.0
"Secretary, you have no plan.",0.0
"In fact, I have written a book about it.",0.0
"It's called ""Stronger Together.""",0.0
We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.,0.0
"And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.",0.0
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.,0.0
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.,0.0
You are going to drive business out.,0.0
"Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.",0.0
"And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.",0.0
I'm very proud of it.,0.0
It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.,1.0
"But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.",0.0
"When I go around—Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.",0.0
"You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.",0.0
And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.,0.0
I'm going to cut regulations.,0.0
"I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.",0.0
"So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.",0.0
What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.,0.0
"What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.",0.0
And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.,0.0
You know what?,0.0
It's no difference than this.,0.0
She's telling us how to fight ISIS.,0.0
Just go to her website.,0.0
She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.,0.0
I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.,1.0
"No, we're not.",0.0
"See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.",0.0
No wonder you've been fighting—no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.,0.0
They're going to expand their companies.,0.0
They're going to do a tremendous job.,1.0
I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.,1.0
"And if you really look, it's not a tax—it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.",0.0
It's a great thing for the middle class.,0.0
It's a great thing for companies to expand.,0.0
"And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what—is so bad.",0.0
"So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.",0.0
"Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.",0.0
Because we have—we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.,0.0
And here's the thing.,0.0
"Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.",0.0
I happen to think it's double that.,0.0
"It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.",0.0
"And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.",1.0
But we have no leadership.,1.0
"And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.",1.0
"I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.",0.0
Why not?,0.0
"Yeah, why not?",0.0
"[laughter]You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.",0.0
"Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.",0.0
We've looked at your tax proposals.,0.0
"I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.",0.0
I happen to support that.,0.0
I happen to—I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.,0.0
"But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.",0.0
Trickle-down did not work.,0.0
"It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.",1.0
Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.,0.0
"And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.",0.0
"And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.",0.0
I don't think top-down works in America.,0.0
"I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their—their debt from college at a lower rate.",0.0
Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.,0.0
"Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.",0.0
"All talk, no action.",1.0
"Sounds good, doesn't work.",0.0
Never going to happen.,0.0
Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.,0.0
"Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.",0.0
And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.,0.0
"And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.",1.0
"We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.",1.0
And we better be awfully careful.,0.0
And we have a Fed that's doing political things.,0.0
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.,0.0
The Fed is doing political—by keeping the interest rates at this level.,0.0
The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.,0.0
I don't mind releasing—I'm under a routine audit.,0.0
And it'll be released.,0.0
"And—as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.",0.0
"But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.",0.0
"It shows income—in fact, the income—I just looked today—the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.",0.0
"If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.",0.0
But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.,0.0
"When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody—Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.",1.0
You know what that is?,0.0
"That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?",0.0
We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.,0.0
"Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.",0.0
I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.,0.0
"I said, do you get audited?",0.0
I get audited almost every year.,0.0
"And in a way, I should be complaining.",0.0
I'm not even complaining.,0.0
I don't mind it.,0.0
It's almost become a way of life.,0.0
I get audited by the IRS.,0.0
But other people don't.,0.0
I will say this.,0.0
We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.,0.0
"I will release my tax returns—against my lawyer's wishes—when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted.",0.0
"As soon as she releases them, I will release.",0.0
I will release my tax returns.,0.0
"And that's against—my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it.""",0.0
I will tell you this.,0.0
"No—in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.",0.0
"Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.",0.0
"When the audit's complete, I'll do it.",0.0
But I would go against them if she releases her emails.,0.0
"It's not negotiable, no.",0.0
Let her release the emails.,0.0
"For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.",0.0
"You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.",0.0
We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.,0.0
"So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?",0.0
And I think there may be a couple of reasons.,0.0
"First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.",1.0
"Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.",1.0
"Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.",1.0
"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.",0.0
"So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.",0.0
"And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.",0.0
"And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.",0.0
They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.,0.0
And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.,0.0
"And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.",0.0
And we'll guess.,0.0
We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.,0.0
"But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?",0.0
Who does he owe money to?,0.0
"Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.",0.0
I do.,0.0
"You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.",0.0
That's for sure.,0.0
"And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.",0.0
But I'm not going to make any excuses.,0.0
"It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.",0.0
That was more than a mistake.,0.0
That was done purposely.,0.0
That was not a mistake.,0.0
"When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.",1.0
"And believe me, this country thinks it's—really thinks it's disgraceful, also.",0.0
"As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.",0.0
That I can tell you.,0.0
You learn a lot from financial disclosure.,0.0
And you should go down and take a look at that.,0.0
"The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.",0.0
"The report that said $650—which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.",0.0
It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.,0.0
And the $650 isn't even on that.,0.0
But it's not $650.,0.0
It's much less than that.,0.0
"These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.",0.0
I could do that very quickly.,0.0
I am very underleveraged.,0.0
I have a great company.,0.0
I have a tremendous income.,0.0
And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.,0.0
It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.,0.0
"When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.",0.0
Our airports are like from a third world country.,0.0
"You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible—you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land—we've become a third world country.",0.0
So the worst of all things has happened.,0.0
"We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.",0.0
We haven't even started.,0.0
"And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.",0.0
"Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.",0.0
And it's really a shame.,0.0
And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.,0.0
Our country has tremendous problems.,0.0
We're a debtor nation.,0.0
We're a serious debtor nation.,0.0
"And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.",0.0
"And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.",0.0
And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.,0.0
"You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.",0.0
"And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.",1.0
"I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.",1.0
We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.,1.0
It's a beautiful facility.,1.0
It immediately was put to use.,1.0
"Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?",0.0
I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.,0.0
"He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.",0.0
"And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.",0.0
There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.,0.0
You call yourself the King of Debt.,1.0
You talk about leverage.,0.0
You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.,0.0
"Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.",0.0
"Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.",0.0
"Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.",0.0
It's an unbelievable company.,0.0
"Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.",0.0
But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.,0.0
"My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.",0.0
And that's what I do.,0.0
But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.,0.0
I'll give you an example.,0.0
"We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.",0.0
But we're opening the Old Post Office.,0.0
I'm a year ahead of schedule.,0.0
And that's what this country should be doing.,0.0
We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.,0.0
"We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.",0.0
"When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.",0.0
The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.,0.0
And we should be able to do that for our country.,0.0
"Well, you're right.",0.0
Race remains a significant challenge in our country.,0.0
"Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.",0.0
We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.,0.0
And we've got to do several things at the same time.,0.0
We have to restore trust between communities and the police.,0.0
"We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.",0.0
"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.",0.0
"Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.",0.0
"So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.",0.0
I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.,0.0
"But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.",0.0
So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.,0.0
And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.,0.0
"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.",0.0
"So we have to do two things, as I said.",0.0
We have to restore trust.,0.0
We have to work with the police.,0.0
We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.,0.0
"And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.",1.0
"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.",1.0
And we need law and order.,1.0
"If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.",0.0
"And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's—I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long—we need law and order in our country.",1.0
"We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very—I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.",1.0
"You walk down the street, you get shot.",0.0
"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.",0.0
Thousands of shootings.,0.0
"And I'm saying, where is this?",0.0
Is this a war-torn country?,0.0
What are we doing?,0.0
And we have to stop the violence.,0.0
We have to bring back law and order.,1.0
"In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over—almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.",1.0
"Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.",1.0
It brought the crime rate way down.,0.0
But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.,0.0
We have gangs roaming the street.,0.0
"And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.",0.0
And they have guns.,0.0
And they shoot people.,0.0
And we have to be very strong.,0.0
And we have to be very vigilant.,0.0
We have to be—we have to know what we're doing.,0.0
"Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.",0.0
"We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.",0.0
"No, you're wrong.",0.0
"It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.",0.0
It was taken away from her.,0.0
"And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.",0.0
They would have won an appeal.,0.0
"If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.",0.0
These are felons.,0.0
"These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be—when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.",1.0
"And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.",0.0
And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.,0.0
"Well, I've heard—I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.",0.0
"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.",0.0
There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.,0.0
But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.,0.0
"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.",0.0
"Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.",0.0
It did not do what it needed to do.,0.0
"Now, I believe in community policing.",0.0
"And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.",0.0
Property crime is down 40 percent.,0.0
We just don't want to see it creep back up.,0.0
We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.,0.0
"But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.",0.0
Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.,0.0
"And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.",0.0
So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,0.0
We cannot just say law and order.,0.0
"We have to say—we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.",0.0
We need to have more second chance programs.,0.0
I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.,0.0
You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.,0.0
So there are some positive ways we can work on this.,0.0
And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.,0.0
"Right now—and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby—right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.",0.0
"In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.",0.0
"We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.",0.0
And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.,0.0
"If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.",0.0
"So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",0.0
"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.",0.0
"I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.",0.0
"And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?",0.0
"But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.",0.0
"I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.",0.0
They admit it's an issue.,0.0
They've got a lot of concerns.,0.0
"Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.",0.0
"They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.",0.0
And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.,0.0
"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.",0.0
I agree with you.,0.0
"When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.",1.0
"These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.",0.0
But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.,0.0
"And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.",0.0
But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.,1.0
I think you've apologized for it.,0.0
But I think it was a terrible thing to say.,0.0
"Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.",0.0
"I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe—in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.",0.0
"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?",0.0
"But we went from 2,200 to 500.",0.0
And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.,0.0
And it was terminated by current mayor.,0.0
But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.,1.0
Tremendous beyond belief.,1.0
"So when you say it has no impact, it really did.",0.0
"It had a very, very big impact.",0.0
"Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.",0.0
You're wrong.,0.0
"No, I'm not.",0.0
Murders are up.,0.0
All right.,0.0
You check it.,0.0
New York—New York has done an excellent job.,0.0
"And I give credit—I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.",0.0
"And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.",0.0
"Look, one murder is too many.",0.0
But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.,0.0
And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.,0.0
Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?,0.0
"But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.",0.0
"And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.",0.0
I'd just like to respond.,0.0
I will.,0.0
"Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.",0.0
"They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.",0.0
"The African-American community—because—look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.",0.0
"They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.",0.0
They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.,0.0
"You decided to stay home, and that's OK.",0.0
"But I will tell you, I've been all over.",0.0
And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.,0.0
"And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.",0.0
"And, yes, I did.",0.0
And you know what else I prepared for?,0.0
I prepared to be president.,0.0
And I think that's a good thing.,0.0
"I'll tell you very—well, just very simple to say.",0.0
"And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.",0.0
They were pressing it very hard.,0.0
She failed to get the birth certificate.,0.0
"When I got involved, I didn't fail.",0.0
I got him to give the birth certificate.,0.0
So I'm satisfied with it.,0.0
And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.,0.0
"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.",0.0
"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.",0.0
But nobody was caring much about it.,0.0
But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.,0.0
And I think I did a good job.,0.0
Secretary Clinton also fought it.,0.0
"I mean, you know—now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.",0.0
"Look, it's true.",0.0
"Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter—you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.",0.0
And she was involved.,0.0
"But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.",0.0
"I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.",0.0
He should have produced it a long time before.,0.0
I say nothing.,0.0
But let me just tell you.,0.0
"When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.",0.0
I think you can see that.,0.0
And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.,0.0
"And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.",0.0
"Well, just listen to what you heard.",0.0
"[laughter]And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.",1.0
But it can't be dismissed that easily.,0.0
He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.,1.0
"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.",0.0
"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.",0.0
He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.,0.0
So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.,1.0
And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.,1.0
"You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.",0.0
And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.,0.0
"But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.",0.0
"And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.",0.0
I would love to respond.,0.0
"First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.",0.0
You treated him with terrible disrespect.,0.0
And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.,0.0
It doesn't work that way.,0.0
"You were after him, you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.",0.0
I don't think you can deny that.,0.0
"But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.",0.0
"So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.",0.0
It really doesn't.,0.0
"Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued.",0.0
We settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt.,0.0
It was very easy to do.,0.0
I notice you bring that up a lot.,0.0
"And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.",0.0
Maybe I'm trying to save the money.,0.0
"But, frankly, I look—I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?",0.0
"Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.",0.0
I'll go one step further.,0.0
"In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.",0.0
"No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.",0.0
And it's a tremendously successful club.,1.0
And I'm so glad I did it.,0.0
And I have been given great credit for what I did.,0.0
"And I'm very, very proud of it.",0.0
And that's the way I feel.,0.0
That is the true way I feel.,0.0
"Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.",0.0
"But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.",0.0
The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.,0.0
"There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.",0.0
"And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.",0.0
"And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.",0.0
"And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.",0.0
And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.,0.0
We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.,0.0
But we will defend the citizens of this country.,0.0
And the Russians need to understand that.,0.0
"I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.",0.0
And that's why I was so—I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.,0.0
That is just unacceptable.,0.0
It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.,0.0
"That just happened, and many more are coming.",0.0
And I'm very proud of it.,1.0
"In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.",1.0
They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.,0.0
I was just endorsed by ICE.,0.0
"I was just recently endorsed—16,500 Border Patrol agents.",0.0
"So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.",0.0
OK?,0.0
Because look at the mess that we're in.,0.0
Look at the mess that we're in.,0.0
"As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.",0.0
"We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.",0.0
I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.,0.0
"She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't—maybe it was.",0.0
"I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.",0.0
It could also be lots of other people.,0.0
"It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?",0.0
You don't know who broke in to DNC.,0.0
But what did we learn with DNC?,0.0
"We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.",0.0
Look what happened to her.,0.0
But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.,0.0
"Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.",0.0
"We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.",0.0
ISIS.,0.0
"So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.",0.0
It is—it is a huge problem.,0.0
I have a son.,0.0
He's 10 years old.,0.0
He has computers.,0.0
"He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.",0.0
"The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.",0.0
And maybe it's hardly doable.,0.0
"But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.",0.0
But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.,0.0
"We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.",0.0
"Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.",0.0
I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.,0.0
It does involve going after them online.,0.0
"I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.",0.0
"But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.",0.0
We're making progress.,0.0
Our military is assisting in Iraq.,0.0
"And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.",0.0
"But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.",0.0
And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.,0.0
"I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.",0.0
"And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.",0.0
"Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.",0.0
"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.",0.0
Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.,0.0
"""We will take out ISIS.""",0.0
"Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out—what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.",0.0
And ISIS was formed.,0.0
So she talks about taking them out.,0.0
She's been doing it a long time.,0.0
She's been trying to take them out for a long time.,0.0
"But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.",0.0
And then you wouldn't have had them.,0.0
"Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil—and we should have taken the oil—ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.",0.0
"And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil—a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",1.0
"Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.",0.0
Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.,0.0
That is absolutely proved over and over again.,0.0
"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.",0.0
"But the larger point—and he says this constantly—is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.",0.0
"And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.",0.0
"But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.",0.0
"The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?",0.0
That's the most important part of this.,0.0
How do we prevent attacks?,0.0
How do we protect our people?,0.0
"And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.",0.0
"I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.",0.0
"You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.",0.0
And they brought him down.,0.0
"And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.",0.0
"So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.",0.0
"That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.",0.0
"We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.",0.0
"We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.",0.0
"Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.",0.0
They're on the front lines.,0.0
They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.,0.0
"They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.",0.0
"The secretary said very strongly about working with—we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.",0.0
"You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.",1.0
"Under your direction, to a large extent.",0.0
"But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.",1.0
They were choking on the sanctions.,1.0
"And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.",0.0
"But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?",0.0
"And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.",0.0
I did really well.,0.0
But I have common sense.,0.0
"And I said, well, I'll tell you.",0.0
I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.,0.0
But two things.,0.0
"Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.",0.0
"Number two—and that bothers me, because we should be asking—we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.",0.0
"And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because—and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest—but I said, they do not focus on terror.",1.0
And I was very strong.,0.0
And I said it numerous times.,0.0
"And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.",0.0
And I think that's great.,0.0
And I think we should get—because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.,0.0
It's a lot of money to protect other people.,0.0
But I'm all for NATO.,0.0
"But I said they have to focus on terror, also.",0.0
And they're going to do that.,0.0
And that was—believe me—I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it—but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.,0.0
"I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.",0.0
"And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.",0.0
"Not only that, you named the day.",0.0
They couldn't believe it.,0.0
"They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.",0.0
"When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.",0.0
It should have never happened.,0.0
"Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.",0.0
"But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.",0.0
Now it's in over 30 countries.,0.0
And you're going to stop them?,0.0
I don't think so.,0.0
I was against the war in Iraq.,0.0
Just so you put it out.,0.0
"When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?",0.0
I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.,0.0
We talked about the economy is more important.,0.0
"I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.",0.0
I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.,0.0
"And Sean Hannity said—and he called me the other day—and I spoke to him about it—he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.",0.0
And that was before the war started.,0.0
I was against the war.,0.0
"He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.",0.0
"And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.",0.0
But nobody called Sean Hannity.,0.0
"And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.",0.0
I think in '04.,0.0
But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.,0.0
"And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely—because if you read this article, there's no doubt.",0.0
He and I used to have arguments about the war.,0.0
"I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.",0.0
It's going to destabilize the Middle East.,0.0
And that's exactly what it's done.,0.0
It's been a disaster.,0.0
"Well, I have much better judgment than she does.",0.0
There's no question about that.,0.0
"I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?",1.0
"[laughter]I have a much better—she spent—let me tell you—she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising—you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names—oh, temperament, let's go after—I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.",0.0
I have a winning temperament.,0.0
I know how to win.,0.0
Wait.,0.0
"The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.",1.0
"I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.",1.0
"Whew, OK. [laughter]Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.",0.0
"You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.",0.0
And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?,0.0
"After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.",0.0
"With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.",0.0
They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.,0.0
They had built covert facilities.,0.0
They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.,0.0
And we had sanctioned them.,0.0
"I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.",0.0
So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.,0.0
And we did drive them to the negotiating table.,0.0
"And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.",0.0
That's diplomacy.,0.0
That's coalition-building.,0.0
That's working with other nations.,0.0
"The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.",0.0
"He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.",0.0
That's not good judgment.,0.0
"That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.",0.0
"He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",0.0
"It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.",0.0
"And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.",1.0
That is the number-one threat we face in the world.,0.0
And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.,0.0
"So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.",0.0
"That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.",0.0
It well describes the problem.,0.0
[laughter]It's not an accurate one at all.,0.0
It's not an accurate one.,0.0
So I just want to give a lot of things—and just to respond.,0.0
I agree with her on one thing.,0.0
"The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your—your president thinks.",0.0
Nuclear is the single greatest threat.,0.0
"Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.",0.0
"But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.",0.0
That's why we're losing—we're losing—we lose on everything.,1.0
"I say, who makes these—we lose on everything.",0.0
"All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.",0.0
"All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.",0.0
We're a country that owes $20 trillion.,0.0
They have to help us out.,0.0
It is the single greatest threat that this country has.,0.0
"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.",0.0
But Russia has been expanding their—they have a much newer capability than we do.,0.0
We have not been updating from the new standpoint.,0.0
I looked the other night.,0.0
"I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.",0.0
We are not—we are not keeping up with other countries.,0.0
"I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.",0.0
But I would certainly not do first strike.,0.0
"I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.",0.0
"At the same time, we have to be prepared.",0.0
I can't take anything off the table.,0.0
"Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.",0.0
China should solve that problem for us.,0.0
China should go into North Korea.,0.0
"And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.",0.0
Iran has power over North Korea.,0.0
"And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.",0.0
And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.,0.0
"And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?",0.0
Why didn't you add other things into the deal?,0.0
"One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.",0.0
Nobody's ever seen that before.,0.0
That turned out to be wrong.,0.0
"It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.",0.0
It certainly looks that way.,0.0
"So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?",0.0
This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.,0.0
The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.,0.0
"All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.",0.0
And they're going to end up getting nuclear.,0.0
Words matter when you run for president.,0.0
And they really matter when you are president.,0.0
And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.,0.0
It is essential that America's word be good.,0.0
I've talked with a number of them.,0.0
"But I want to—on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.",0.0
It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.,0.0
There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.,0.0
"But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.",0.0
And Donald never tells you what he would do.,0.0
Would he have started a war?,0.0
Would he have bombed Iran?,0.0
"If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.",0.0
But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.,0.0
"He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.",0.0
So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.,0.0
"People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.",0.0
Can they rely on us?,0.0
Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?,0.0
That's what I intend to do.,0.0
"I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.",0.0
I will go very quickly.,0.0
"But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.",0.0
"Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.",0.0
"And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.",0.0
We cannot be the policemen of the world.,0.0
We need heart.,0.0
We need a lot of things.,0.0
But you have to have some basic ability.,0.0
"And sadly, she doesn't have that.",1.0
"All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.",0.0
But they weren't taken care of.,0.0
She doesn't have the look.,1.0
She doesn't have the stamina.,1.0
I said she doesn't have the stamina.,1.0
And I don't believe she does have the stamina.,1.0
"To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.",0.0
You asked me a question.,0.0
Did you ask me a question?,0.0
You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.,0.0
"You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.",0.0
"I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?",0.0
"And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?",0.0
All you have to do is speak to them.,0.0
"You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.",1.0
"Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.",0.0
The world—let me tell you.,0.0
Let me tell you.,0.0
"Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.",0.0
"We have made so many bad deals during the last—so she's got experience, that I agree.",0.0
"But it's bad, bad experience.",1.0
"Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can—name—you almost can't name a good deal.",0.0
I agree.,0.0
"She's got experience, but it's bad experience.",0.0
And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.,0.0
"One thing, Lester.",0.0
"You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.",0.0
And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.,0.0
"He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.",0.0
"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy.""",0.0
"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina.",0.0
"Donald, she has a name.",0.0
Where did you find this?,0.0
Her name is Alicia Machado.,0.0
Some of it's said in entertainment.,0.0
"Some of it's said—somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.",0.0
But you want to know the truth?,0.0
I just can't do it.,0.0
It's inappropriate.,0.0
"It's not nice.""",0.0
"But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.",0.0
They're untrue.,0.0
And they're misrepresentations.,0.0
"And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.",0.0
And I don't deserve that.,0.0
But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.,0.0
It's hundreds of millions of ads.,0.0
"Well, I support our democracy.",0.0
"And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.",0.0
But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.,0.0
"And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.",0.0
It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.,0.0
"So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.",0.0
I want to make America great again.,1.0
We are a nation that is seriously troubled.,0.0
We're losing our jobs.,0.0
People are pouring into our country.,0.0
"The other day, we were deporting 800 people.",0.0
"And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.",0.0
Ended up becoming citizens.,0.0
And it was 800.,0.0
"And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.",0.0
"Look, here's the story.",0.0
I'm going to be able to do it.,0.0
I don't believe Hillary will.,0.0
"The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.",0.0
"Well, thank you.",0.0
Are you a teacher?,0.0
"Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.",0.0
"Well, I actually agree with that.",0.0
I agree with everything she said.,0.0
I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.,1.0
This is a great country.,0.0
This is a great land.,0.0
I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.,0.0
"I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.",0.0
And my whole concept was to make America great again.,1.0
"When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.",1.0
"No, I didn't say that at all.",0.0
I'm not proud of it.,0.0
I apologize to my family.,0.0
I apologize to the American people.,0.0
Certainly I'm not proud of it.,0.0
But this is locker room talk.,0.0
I have great respect for women.,0.0
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,0.0
"I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.",0.0
And I was embarrassed by it.,0.0
But I have tremendous respect for women.,1.0
And women have respect for me.,0.0
"And I will tell you: No, I have not.",0.0
And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.,1.0
"We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.",0.0
"People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.",0.0
"Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.",0.0
And that's what I want to talk about.,0.0
"Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.",0.0
"You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.",0.0
"These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.",1.0
And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.,0.0
I assume I am.,0.0
"It's just words, folks.",1.0
It's just words.,1.0
"Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.",0.0
"I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.",0.0
Sounds fair.,0.0
That was locker room talk.,0.0
"I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.",0.0
"And certainly, I'm not proud of it.",0.0
But that was something that happened.,0.0
"Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.",0.0
He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.,0.0
"Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.",0.0
"When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.",1.0
"He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.",0.0
And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.,1.0
So you really owe him an apology.,1.0
"You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.",0.0
"That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.",0.0
I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.,0.0
Because you'd be in jail.,1.0
"Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.",0.0
I'm not making any excuses.,0.0
It was a mistake.,0.0
And I am very sorry about that.,0.0
Right?,0.0
"If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.",0.0
"Look, it's just not true.",0.0
"It was personal emails, not official.",0.0
"Oh, 33,000?",0.0
"What about the other 15,000?",0.0
"Yes, that's true, I didn't.",0.0
Because you have nothing to say.,0.0
"I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.",0.0
"OK, Donald.",0.0
"I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.",0.0
Let's get to their questions.,0.0
"I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the emails?",0.0
I'd like to know.,0.0
It hasn't.,0.0
And it hasn't been finished at all.,0.0
"If he wants to start, he can start.",0.0
"No, go ahead, Donald.",0.0
Go ahead.,0.0
"And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.",0.0
Premiums have gotten too high.,0.0
"Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.",0.0
"Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.",0.0
That's the highest we've ever been in our country.,0.0
"So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.",0.0
"It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.",0.0
Obamacare is a disaster.,1.0
You know it.,1.0
We all know it.,1.0
It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.,0.0
Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.,0.0
"No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.",0.0
And it's very clear.,0.0
"Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.",0.0
But we have an employer-based system.,0.0
That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.,0.0
"So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.",0.0
That's not going to work.,0.0
"First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.",0.0
Everything.,0.0
"Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.",1.0
"This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.",0.0
"You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.",0.0
"President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.",0.0
"President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.",0.0
"The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.",0.0
"Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.",0.0
"I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.",0.0
And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.,1.0
"When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.",1.0
"As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.",1.0
Horribly wounded.,1.0
They'll never be the same.,1.0
Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.,0.0
"Well, thank you for asking your question.",0.0
"And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.",1.0
"And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.",0.0
"My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.",1.0
That's what America is.,1.0
That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.,1.0
"First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.",0.0
So he would have been alive today.,0.0
It's called extreme vetting.,0.0
We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.,0.0
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.,0.0
"People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.",0.0
This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.,1.0
"Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.",0.0
Has not been debunked.,0.0
And you voted for it.,0.0
And you shouldn't have.,0.0
She just went about 25 seconds over her time.,0.0
"Could I just respond to this, please?",0.0
"Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.",1.0
"When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.",0.0
"In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.",1.0
And they don't want them.,0.0
"Well, right.",0.0
"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln.""",0.0
It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.,0.0
"It was principled, and it was strategic.",0.0
"Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.",0.0
But we deserve answers.,0.0
And she lied.,1.0
"Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.",0.0
"Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.",0.0
"One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.",0.0
"And she could have done this years ago, by the way.",0.0
"Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.",0.0
"I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.",1.0
And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.,1.0
Of course I do.,0.0
"And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.",0.0
I know many of her donors.,0.0
Her donors took massive tax write-offs.,0.0
"And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.",0.0
That's why.,0.0
"No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.",0.0
"But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.",1.0
I love depreciation.,0.0
"You know, she's given it to us.",0.0
She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.,0.0
"She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.",0.0
"I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.",0.0
"They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.",0.0
Congratulations.,0.0
Great job.,0.0
"Well, here we go again.",0.0
"I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.",0.0
But that's not the point here.,0.0
Why didn't you do it?,0.0
Because I was a senator with a Republican president.,0.0
"Oh, really?",0.0
"If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",0.0
But you were not an effective senator.,0.0
"You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.",0.0
"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that.""",0.0
So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.,0.0
I'm very glad to do so.,1.0
I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.,0.0
"And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.",0.0
She said a lot of things that were false.,0.0
Because she has been a disaster as a senator.,1.0
A disaster.,1.0
"Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.",0.0
"And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.",1.0
And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.,0.0
I was gone.,0.0
"You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.",0.0
I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.,0.0
And one thing I have to say.,0.0
"I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.",0.0
Russia is killing ISIS.,0.0
And Iran is killing ISIS.,0.0
And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.,0.0
"He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.",0.0
I disagree.,0.0
I think you have to knock out ISIS.,0.0
"Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.",0.0
We have people that want to fight both at the same time.,0.0
But Syria is no longer Syria.,0.0
"Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.",0.0
"I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.",1.0
I think that it basically has fallen.,0.0
OK?,0.0
Let me tell you something.,0.0
You take a look at Mosul.,0.0
"The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.",1.0
They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.,0.0
"So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.",0.0
"Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.",0.0
Why can't they do it quietly?,1.0
"Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?",1.0
People leave.,0.0
"Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?",0.0
How stupid is our country?,1.0
I can't think of any.,0.0
I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.,1.0
We talk about it all the time.,1.0
"They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?",0.0
They're gone.,0.0
"Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.",0.0
I would not use American ground forces in Syria.,0.0
I think that would be a very serious mistake.,1.0
"I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.",0.0
I don't think that is a smart strategy.,0.0
I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.,0.0
I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.,0.0
"And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.",0.0
"No, he doesn't.",0.0
I would go after Baghdadi.,0.0
So I think that could help.,0.0
"She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.",0.0
"When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.",0.0
Absolutely.,1.0
"I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.",1.0
I will be a president for all of our people.,0.0
"I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.",1.0
Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.,0.0
She's been talking about it for years.,0.0
"As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.",0.0
She doesn't get it done.,0.0
"But I will tell you, she's all talk.",0.0
It doesn't get done.,0.0
All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.,0.0
Take a look at upstate New York.,0.0
It turned out to be a disaster.,0.0
"Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.",0.0
"Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.",0.0
"If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.",0.0
I want to be the best president I can be for every American.,0.0
"Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.",0.0
"It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.",1.0
Because we talked about what we wanted to do.,0.0
And I was proud of that.,0.0
We have a divided nation.,0.0
We have a very divided nation.,0.0
You look at Charlotte.,0.0
You look at Baltimore.,0.0
"And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.",0.0
"No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.",0.0
It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.,1.0
"By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.",0.0
She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?,0.0
Guess what?,0.0
"Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.",0.0
But she said she'll be awake.,0.0
Guess what happened?,0.0
"And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.",1.0
"So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.",0.0
No.,0.0
I'm shocked to hear that.,0.0
"It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.",0.0
"But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.",0.0
Everybody.,0.0
African-American incomes went up 33 percent.,0.0
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,0.0
We are back on the right track.,0.0
He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.,0.0
"I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.",0.0
Under absolutely siege.,0.0
"The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.",0.0
It's an absolute disgrace.,1.0
"First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.",0.0
That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.,0.0
So we have to look at this comprehensively.,0.0
And that's exactly what I have proposed.,0.0
I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.,0.0
Have you seen it?,0.0
Take a look at it.,0.0
That's right.,0.0
"Well, Aleppo is a disaster.",1.0
It's a humanitarian nightmare.,0.0
"I mean, what do you need, a signed document?",0.0
Take a look at Aleppo.,0.0
It is so sad when you see what's happened.,0.0
And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.,0.0
"Lots of luck, Hillary.",0.0
Thanks a lot for doing a great job.,0.0
"Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.",0.0
I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.,0.0
It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.,0.0
We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.,0.0
"And right now, they're in 32 countries.",0.0
They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.,0.0
"Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.",0.0
"And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.",0.0
"To do that, we're taking back jobs.",0.0
"We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.",0.0
It's very sad.,0.0
But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.,0.0
We used to be there.,0.0
We've given it up.,0.0
"We've become very, very sloppy.",0.0
"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great.",0.0
"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.",0.0
I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.,0.0
"And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.",0.0
"Thank you, Hillary.",0.0
Could I just respond?,0.0
I disagreed with him.,0.0
We should have been much tougher on trade even then.,0.0
I've been waiting for years.,0.0
Nobody does it right.,0.0
The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States.,1.0
They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already.,0.0
The election has already started.,0.0
Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait.,0.0
We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.,0.0
"Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.",0.0
"He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that.",0.0
Women's rights are fundamentally changed.,0.0
They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.,0.0

"And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that and frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to reelection, based on this.",0.0
Susan Thank you.,0.0
And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event.,0.0
"And Senator Harris, it's a privilege to be on the stage with you.",0.0
Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year.,0.0
"Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done.",0.0
"And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world.",0.0
"He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II.",1.0
And I believe it's saved hundreds of thousands of American lives.,1.0
Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing.,0.0
More than 115 million tests have been done to date.,0.0
We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed.,0.0
"And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that've been saving lives all along the way.",0.0
"The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way.",1.0
"And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about.",1.0
"I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made.",1.0
It's saved countless American lives.,0.0
"Oh, absolutely.",0.0
"Whatever the Vice President's claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn't worked when you're looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss.",1.0
"And you know, the vice president is the head of the task force and knew, on January 28, how serious this was.",0.0
"And then, big thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it.",0.0
"So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you're going to get your next roll of toilet paper?",1.0
How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn't know when they could go back?,1.0
You know there's not a day gone by that I haven't thought of every American family that's lost a loved one.,1.0
And I want all of you to know that you'll always be in our hearts and in our prayers.,1.0
"But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn't worked, that's a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made.",1.0
"Well, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months that when given the facts they're willing to put the health of their families, and their neighbors and people they don't even know first.",0.0
President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice.,1.0
"In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit.",1.0
We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices.,1.0
"When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward.",0.0
But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on.,0.0
My wife Karen and I were there and honored to be there.,0.0
"Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus.",0.0
"And it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise, the difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health.",1.0
We're about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.,1.0
So let's talk about caring about the American people.,0.0
The American people who have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration.,1.0
"Well, Susan, thank you.",0.0
"Because the reality is that we're going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time, in unheard of time, in less than a year.",1.0
We have five companies in phase three clinical trials.,0.0
"So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable.",0.0
"The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives.",0.0
"And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it's just unacceptable.",1.0
"And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic.",0.0
It was 2009.,0.0
The Swine Flu arrived in the United States.,0.0
"Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus.",0.0
"But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu.",0.0
"If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives.",0.0
His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck.,0.0
And we learned from that.,0.0
They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty.,0.0
"They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learned from it.",0.0
And the thought that I'd be sitting here right now I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this.,1.0
You know Joe and I were raised in a very similar way.,1.0
"We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people.",1.0
"And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system.",0.0
"I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman, to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice.",1.0
"There I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans.",0.0
"And then, of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate.",1.0
I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I've been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world.,0.0
I've traveled the world.,0.0
"I've met with our soldiers in our, in war zones.",0.0
"And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share, we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people.",0.0
"And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump, unifying our country around our common values and principles.",0.0
"And let me, let me say on behalf of the president and the First Lady, how moved we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President.",1.0
And I do believe it's emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the coronavirus.,0.0
"But I'm just extremely grateful and was more than, more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support.",0.0
"And, Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern.",0.0
"And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination.",0.0
"On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn't be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.",1.0
"Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America's economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family.",0.0
"On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing.",0.0
"Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for.",0.0
"On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill.",0.0
He'll get rid of it.,0.0
"And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do.",0.0
But Joe Biden will do that.,0.0
He'll invest in infrastructure.,0.0
"It's about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy.",0.0
Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation.,0.0
There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe.,0.0
Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education.,0.0
"So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free.",0.0
"If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you'll go to a public university for free.",0.0
"And across the board, we'll make sure that if you have student loan debt it's cut by $10,000.",0.0
"That's how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it's about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business.",0.0
Okay?,0.0
"Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year.",0.0
He has been very clear about that.,0.0
Joe Biden will not end fracking.,0.0
Joe Biden is the one who during the Great Recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back.,0.0
And now the Trump Pence Administration wants to take credit when they ran when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden's success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term.,0.0
"Of course now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand, did that.",1.0
"On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression.",0.0
"On the one hand you have Joe Biden, who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to over 20 million Americans and protected people with pre existing conditions and what it also did is it saved those families, who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford.",0.0
"If you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they're coming for you.",1.0
"Well first, I'm very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation.",0.0
"According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded.",0.0
And our water is among the cleanest in the world.,0.0
"So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment.",0.0
"Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing.",0.0
"But the issue is, what's the cause and what do we do about it.",0.0
President Trump has made it clear that we're going to continue to listen to the science.,0.0
"Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord.",0.0
"They'd impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs.",1.0
President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy.,0.0
"You know what's remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we've done it through innovation.",0.0
"And we've done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record.",0.0
"I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking.",0.0
You know.,0.0
"I think about 20-year-olds, you know we have a 20-year-old, 20-something-year-old, who are coming out of high school and college right now and you're wondering, ""Is there going to be a job there for me?",0.0
""".",0.0
We're looking at people who are trying to figure out how they're going to pay rent by the end of the month.,0.0
Almost half of American renters are worried about whether they're going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month.,0.0
This is where the economy is in America right now and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration.,1.0
"Well, I'd love to respond.",0.0
Joe Biden never fought it.,0.0
Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for Communist China through over the last several decades.,1.0
"And, and again, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your opinion, you're not entitled to your own facts.",0.0
"When Joe Biden was vice president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs and President Obama said they were never coming back.",0.0
He said we needed a magic wand to bring them back.,0.0
Got to be loyal to your friends.,0.0
"People who have stood with you, got to stand with them.",0.0
"You got to know who your adversaries are, and keep them in check.",0.0
But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world.,1.0
"Let's take for example, Russia.",0.0
"So, Russia – I serve on the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate.",0.0
"He has walked away from agreements – you can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe, because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal.",0.0
"So Susan, it's about relationships.",0.0
"And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word.",0.0
"But Donald Trump doesn't understand that, because he doesn't understand what it means to be honest.",0.0
"Well, thank you.",0.0
"Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel.",0.0
"When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and never did.",0.0
NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before.,0.0
"You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania.",0.0
"President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS Caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty.",0.0
"But notably, America's hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City.",0.0
"Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller's murder, were brought to justice in the United States.",0.0
"Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few.",0.0
"The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller.",0.0
"Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office presented a plan.",1.0
They said they knew where Kayla was.,0.0
"Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her.",0.0
"But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month.",0.0
"First of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter's case, and I'm so sorry.",0.0
I'm so sorry.,0.0
What happened to her is awful.,0.0
And it should have never happened.,0.0
And I know Joe feels the same way.,0.0
And I know that President Obama feels the same way.,0.0
But you mentioned Soleimani.,0.0
Let's start there.,0.0
"So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq.",0.0
Headaches.,0.0
"And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump's, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers.",0.0
"Because, of course, you know he only thinks about what's in it for him.",0.0
Let's take what he said about John McCain.,0.0
A great American hero.,1.0
And Donald Trump says he doesn't deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war.,0.0
"When you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about and what they don't care about.",0.0
"Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is?",0.0
"Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed.",0.0
Joe Biden would never do that.,0.0
Joe Biden – Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation's security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety.,0.0
"The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers.",0.0
"When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn't hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone.",0.0
"It's really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it's explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden.",0.0
"It's absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that's what you have in President Donald Trump.",0.0
Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States.,0.0
"She's a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States.",1.0
"And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others.",0.0
We hope she gets a fair hearing.,0.0
And we particularly hope that we don't see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before.,0.0
Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern.,0.0
"Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.",0.0
"Thank you, Susan.",0.0
"First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith.",0.0
"And it's insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States.",1.0
We're literally in an election.,0.0
Over 4 million people have voted.,0.0
People are in the process of voting right now.,0.0
"And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we'll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court.",0.0
"And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn't be more serious.",0.0
"There's the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body.",0.0
"It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence.",0.0
But let's also look at what else is before the court.,0.0
It's the Affordable Care Act.,0.0
And here's the thing.,0.0
The contrast couldn't be more clear.,0.0
They're trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.,0.0
That's true leadership.,0.0
She was a beautiful young woman.,0.0
"She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what's going on out on the street, so she could then become a nurse and save lives.",0.0
"And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently.",1.0
"And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer.",1.0
"And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender – perfect strangers to each other – marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law.",1.0
And I was a part of those peaceful protests.,0.0
I know what I'm talking about.,0.0
Bad cops are bad for good cops.,0.0
"We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds.",0.0
"We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will – on the issue of criminal justice reform – get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana.",0.0
"He didn't do it, and then he doubled down.",0.0
He was – he called Mexicans rapists and criminals.,1.0
He instituted as his first act a Muslim ban.,0.0
"He, on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches shouting racial epithets, anti semitic slurs.",1.0
"And Donald Trump, when asked about it, said there were fine people on both sides.",0.0
This is who we have as the President of the United States.,0.0
"And America, you deserve better.",1.0
Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together.,0.0
I started following the news when I was very young.,0.0
"And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate.",0.0
But what's been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends.,0.0
"But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans.",1.0
We love a good argument.,0.0
And that you know that brings me to Joe.,0.0
"Joe Biden – one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division.",0.0
Joe has a long standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way.,0.0
And that's what he's going to do as President.,0.0
Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity.,0.0
"You mean you have to know Joe's story to know that Joe has known pain, he has known suffering, and he has known love.",1.0
"And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be, because we fight for each person's voice through their vote.",0.0
"And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work, and through, eventually, your vote.",0.0
"To determine the future of our country, and what its leadership looks like.",0.0
We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China.,1.0
It's a worldwide pandemic.,0.0
It's all over the world.,0.0
You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now.,0.0
"If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%.",0.0
"The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country.",0.0
And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard.,0.0
There is a spike.,0.0
"There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone.",0.0
"There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone.",0.0
"There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone.",0.0
And there were some spikes and surges in other places.,0.0
They will soon be gone.,0.0
"We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready.",0.0
"It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered.",0.0
"We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine.",0.0
"I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it.",0.0
"And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it.",0.0
Some people could say it was a cure.,0.0
But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight.,0.0
And now they say I'm immune.,0.0
"Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune.",0.0
More and more people are getting better.,0.0
We have a problem that's a worldwide problem.,0.0
"This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators.",1.0
We're now making ventilators.,0.0
"All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.",0.0
"If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this.",0.0
"Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America.",0.0
"And there are over 70,000 new cases per day.",0.0
"Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate.",0.0
We're starting from a very high rate.,0.0
"The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year.",1.0
No comprehensive plan.,0.0
"What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time.",0.0
"I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing.",0.0
"I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that.",0.0
"We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic.",0.0
"And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.",0.0
Make sure it's totally transparent.,0.0
"And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time.",0.0
"This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer.",0.0
"We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.",1.0
We're opening up our country.,0.0
"When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon.",1.0
"But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me.",0.0
"And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster.",0.0
Far less lethal.,0.0
But it was a total disaster.,0.0
"Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease.",0.0
Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this.,0.0
"Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.",0.0
"My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China.",1.0
"And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that.",0.0
"In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was.",0.0
What did the President say in January?,0.0
"He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent.",0.0
We owe him a debt of gratitude.,0.0
We have to thank him.,0.0
"And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people.",0.0
"And again, I go back to this, he had nothing.",0.0
He did virtually nothing.,0.0
This is all going to be over soon.',0.0
"Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it's going to be over soon.",0.0
I say we're learning to live with it.,0.0
We have no choice.,0.0
We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does.,0.0
He has the ability to lock himself up.,1.0
"I don't know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement.",1.0

That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends.,0.0
They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem.,0.0

Treatment.,0.0
That's what we've been trying to do.,0.0

"Good evening, Mr. Howe.",0.0
"Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans.",0.0
Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.,0.0
I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.,0.0
"There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.",0.0
"And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?",0.0
How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?,0.0
"Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace?",1.0
Who threatens freedom in the world?,1.0
There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.,0.0
I know Mr. Khrushchev.,0.0
I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.,0.0
"I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.",0.0
"First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past.",0.0
"In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.",1.0
"In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed.",0.0
"We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.",0.0
"Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?",0.0
I think there're several reasons.,0.0
"In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.",0.0
One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War.,0.0
"In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area.",0.0
They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war.,0.0
We learned from their mistakes.,0.0
"And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return.",0.0
We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area.,0.0
"But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world.",0.0
"That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done.",0.0
"That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists.",0.0
Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?,0.0
"Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.",0.0
It encourages them to begin a war.,0.0
"And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.",0.0
Let us move now to the future.,0.0
"It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.",1.0
"That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.",0.0
"First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.",0.0
"They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.",0.0
We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace.,0.0
"In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.",0.0
It has grown in the past seven years.,0.0
It can and will grow even more in the next four.,0.0
And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent.,0.0
We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.,0.0
"And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field.",1.0
"And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies.",0.0
What are they?,0.0
Again we turn to the past.,0.0
"Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.",0.0
"When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.",1.0
And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.,0.0
But all this by itself is not enough.,0.0
"It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.",0.0
We must have a great goal.,0.0
"And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.",0.0
To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.,0.0
"And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line.",0.0
"And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.",1.0
"We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.",0.0
"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.",0.0
First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.,0.0
I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955.,0.0
I have sustained it since then.,0.0
I've said that I agree with the Administration policy.,0.0
"Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.",0.0
"I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy.",0.0
I've supported that policy.,0.0
"In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly.",0.0
So that really isn't an issue in this campaign.,0.0
"It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.",0.0
Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.,0.0
The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?,0.0
Is our relative strength growing?,0.0
"Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low?",1.0
I don't believe it is.,1.0
I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing.,1.0
"And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States.",0.0
"I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.",0.0
In 1957 I was in Havana.,0.0
I talked to the American Ambassador there.,0.0
He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.,0.0
"And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done.",0.0
Our d- security depends upon Latin America.,0.0
"Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what's happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call - not on Washington during the campaign - but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil?",0.0
"At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro.",0.0
It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.,0.0
Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do?,0.0
"Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?",0.0
Africa is now the emerging area of the world.,0.0
We didn't even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957.,0.0
"In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.",0.0
If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance.,0.0
And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world.,0.0
"We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.",0.0
"We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate.",0.0
There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.,0.0
We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.,0.0
"Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?",0.0
But are we doing enough in these areas?,0.0
What are freedom's chances in those areas?,0.0
"By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?",0.0
"Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?",0.0
Will the Congo go Communist?,0.0
Will other countries?,0.0
Are we doing enough in that area?,0.0
And what about Asia?,0.0
Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it?,0.0
Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?,0.0
Communism?,0.0
The Chinese?,0.0
Or will freedom?,0.0
The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today?,0.0
Is our strength and prestige rising?,0.0
Do people want to be identified with us?,0.0
Do they want to follow United States leadership?,0.0
"I don't think they do, enough.",0.0
And that's what concerns me.,0.0
In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.,0.0
"On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.",0.0
The rest either abstained or voted against us.,0.0
More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.,0.0
"I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.",0.0
I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.,0.0
I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America.,0.0
I have seen us ignore Africa.,0.0
There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations.,0.0
There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.,0.0
"When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.",0.0
We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.,0.0
"And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.",0.0
"The Communists say, ""Come with us; look what we've done.""",0.0
"And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested.",0.0
I think we're going to have to do better.,0.0
Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.,0.0
I think we are today.,0.0
"But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them.",0.0
"They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles.",0.0
I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.,0.0
He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.,0.0
I agree with him.,0.0
"What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.",0.0
"And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.",0.0
We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.,0.0
I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.,0.0
The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them.,0.0
"The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.",0.0
We want peace.,0.0
We want freedom.,0.0
We want security.,0.0
We want to be stronger.,0.0
We want freedom to gain.,0.0
But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change.,0.0
"I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move.",0.0
I think we have to revita1ize our society.,0.0
"I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.",0.0
"And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.",0.0
Our policies are very different.,0.0
I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.,1.0
"In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista.",0.0
Now let's just see what this means.,0.0
"We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.",0.0
"The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another.",0.0
"Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.",0.0
"But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective.",0.0
I know something else.,0.0
"It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.",0.0
This is the major recommendation that he's made.,0.0
"Now, what can we do?",0.0
"Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.",0.0
There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration.,0.0
We quarantined Mr. Arbenz.,0.0
The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out.,0.0
We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.,0.0
We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.,0.0
"By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.",0.0
"But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.",1.0
"He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains.",0.0
"There isn't any doubt about that, number one.",0.0
"Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.",0.0
They have to include the other countries of Latin America.,0.0
"The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.",0.0
If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro.,0.0
"That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others.",0.0
"Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.",0.0
"The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.",0.0
"We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.",0.0
His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.,0.0
His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.,0.0
"You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro.",0.0
Why didn't we?,0.0
"Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.",0.0
"Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.",0.0
"First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.",0.0
"Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public.",0.0
"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be.",0.0
"Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?",1.0
"Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.",0.0
Well let me make one thing clear.,0.0
"Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.",0.0
Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.,1.0
And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.,0.0
"Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.",0.0
Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.,0.0
Let's look at the vote on Hungary.,0.0
There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.,0.0
Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U. N. session.,0.0
Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?,0.0
Not at all.,0.0
The President gained.,0.0
"America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.",0.0
I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.,0.0
I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.,0.0
"I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.",0.0
"What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country.",0.0
Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.,0.0
The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.,0.0
"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen.",0.0
I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.,0.0
"Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world.",1.0
I said we had too many slums.,0.0
"And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.",0.0
I didn't say we had the worst education in the world.,0.0
"What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.",0.0
"And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.",0.0
"Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.",0.0
"Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.",0.0
"Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.",1.0
"We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.",1.0
"Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.",0.0
"Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.",0.0
This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.,0.0
"By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.",0.0
Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.,0.0
"I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points.",0.0
But let's look at the other side of the coin.,0.0
"If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.",0.0
We do not help it.,0.0
"We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.",0.0
"I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.",0.0
"And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.",0.0
"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say.",0.0
"Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.",0.0
"I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.",0.0
"Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.",0.0
He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.,0.0
He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin.,0.0
"The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.",1.0
"I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.",0.0
"In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.",0.0
The Soviet Union does understand strength.,0.0
"We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.",0.0
"If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.",0.0
And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.,0.0
"But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.",0.0
"I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.",0.0
"I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.",0.0
"One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.",0.0
"I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution.",0.0
We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.,0.0
But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.,0.0
I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.,0.0
"We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.",0.0
We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House.,0.0
I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.,0.0
"Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.",0.0
"They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.",0.0
"No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.",0.0
"If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.",0.0
"Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.",0.0
India started from about the same place that China did.,0.0
Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years.,0.0
India under a free society has been making some progress.,0.0
"But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.",0.0
"Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.",0.0
This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.,0.0
It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.,0.0
They want to be free.,0.0
And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.,0.0
"They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.",0.0
"And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.",0.0
We can make it move.,0.0
We can put the Communists on the defensive.,0.0
"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.",0.0
"Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.",0.0
"And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.",0.0
This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.,0.0
In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.,0.0
"Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.",0.0
I would just like to s- add this one point.,0.0
"If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.",0.0
"We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.",1.0
"If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.",0.0
I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.,1.0
He says he supports the President's position.,0.0
He says that he voted for the resolution.,0.0
Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.,0.0
"But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.",0.0
"He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.",0.0
He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.,0.0
"Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.",0.0
"Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated.",0.0
"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us.",0.0
I support the President's position.,0.0
I have always opposed drawing a line.,0.0
"I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.",0.0
And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.,0.0
"It isn't enough for him to say ""I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution.""",0.0
"Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous.",0.0
"But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate.",0.0
It's very simple for him to clear it up.,0.0
He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.,0.0
"If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.",0.0
"The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.",0.0
"Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.",0.0
The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.,0.0
"I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.",0.0
"General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.",0.0
"The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.",1.0
Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.,0.0
Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.,0.0
"Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.",0.0
"And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.",0.0
I support that.,0.0
"In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.",0.0
"That's not the position you took, however.",0.0
Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.,0.0
You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.,0.0
And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.,0.0
I served it uh - in the war.,0.0
I'm devoted to it.,0.0
"If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.",0.0
"But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.",0.0
"My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.",0.0
We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.,0.0
"If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.",0.0
"And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.",0.0
"I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.",0.0
Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.,0.0
Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.,0.0
"If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?",0.0
Why didn't we bring students over here?,0.0
Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?,0.0
That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government.,0.0
I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has.,0.0
"It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.",0.0
"He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead.",0.0
I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still.,0.0
We can no longer afford to be second best.,0.0
"I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.",0.0
"I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.",0.0
I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.,0.0
"I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.",0.0
And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.,0.0
Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny.,1.0
I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.,1.0
"And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.",0.0
"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.",0.0
America is not standing still.,0.0
It has not been standing still.,0.0
"And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.",0.0
He talks about housing.,0.0
We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.,0.0
We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.,0.0
Let's talk about civil rights.,0.0
More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.,0.0
He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.,1.0
We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.,0.0
Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.,0.0
He's been in some other country.,0.0
Let's get that straight right away.,0.0
"Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.",0.0
America has not been standing still.,0.0
"We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.",0.0
"We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves.",0.0
"It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world.",0.0
And this means more than what we've been doing.,0.0
It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.,0.0
It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.,0.0
It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.,1.0
"Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.",0.0
It sounded fine.,0.0
But let's look at it.,0.0
There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.,0.0
There are only three left.,0.0
Let's look at Africa.,0.0
Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.,0.0
Not one of them selected a Communist government.,0.0
All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.,0.0
"Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?",0.0
Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?,0.0
Of course not.,0.0
"What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.",0.0
We're on the side of freedom.,0.0
"We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice.",0.0
But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.,0.0
"Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.",0.0
One other point I would make: what could you do?,0.0
Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States.,0.0
And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.,0.0
"What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?",0.0
"It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.",0.0
"It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people.",0.0
"In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.",0.0
"And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong.",0.0
"See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.",0.0
Yes.,0.0
First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.,0.0
"This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.",0.0
"We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.",0.0
There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.,0.0
"First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.",0.0
"Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.",0.0
"These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment.",0.0
"There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.",0.0
"ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.",0.0
Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.,0.0
"And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.",0.0
I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.,0.0
But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.,0.0
I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.,0.0
I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.,1.0
"That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government.",0.0
We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.,0.0
"We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed.",0.0
We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.,0.0
"Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time.",0.0
"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.",0.0
"I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition.",0.0
"That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend.",0.0
"But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction.",0.0
"In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.",0.0
For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.,0.0
We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.,0.0
"With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed.",0.0
"And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.",0.0
That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.,0.0
"And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.",0.0
"I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.",0.0
So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.,0.0
"Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.",0.0
It has some good provisions in it.,0.0
"It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately.",0.0
"On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.",0.0
"And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.",0.0
"Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.",1.0
The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich.,1.0
"When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.",0.0
"In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.",0.0
"In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.",0.0
"The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.",0.0
And this is what the Republicans have done to us.,0.0
And this is why a tax reform is so important.,0.0
"Well, as a matter of fact there is.",0.0
"If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.",0.0
Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.,0.0
"I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.",0.0
I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.,0.0
And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.,0.0
I stand behind them.,0.0
"And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I'll phase in the programs that we've uh - advocated, more slowly.",0.0
"Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.",0.0
"I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now.",0.0
And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.,0.0
"Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.",0.0
Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.,0.0
The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.,1.0
"And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.",0.0
"And also, I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh - assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent.",0.0
"But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president.",0.0
Keep my promises to the American people.,1.0
"And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.",0.0
"If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude.",0.0
I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.,0.0
It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.,0.0
"But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.",0.0
"And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.",0.0
"And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.",0.0
"Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.",0.0
I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.,0.0
"We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.",0.0
The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.,0.0
We gave them ample time.,0.0
I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.,0.0
"Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition.",1.0
"There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.",0.0
"Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.",0.0
"It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.",0.0
Mr. Nixon resigned.,0.0
That is disgrace.,0.0
The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.,0.0
"Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders.",0.0
I do not agree with that point of view.,0.0
"I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.",0.0
I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.,0.0
Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.,0.0
There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.,0.0
"Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.",0.0
"But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair.",0.0
But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.,0.0
"Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.",0.0
"We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.",0.0
"In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.",0.0
Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.,0.0
We can only be strong overseas if we're strong at home; and when I became president we'll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense - a defense capability second to none.,0.0
"We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people.",1.0
We've uh - ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy.,0.0
It's been one of secrecy and exclusion.,0.0
"In addition to that we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world.",0.0
"We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.",0.0
In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.,0.0
We talk about detente.,0.0
"The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.",0.0
We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance.,0.0
The other point I wanna make is about our defense.,0.0
"We've got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that's efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused - fighting capability.",0.0
"The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight.",0.0
"And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.",0.0
Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.,1.0
This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.,1.0
"I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.",0.0
"Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be.",0.0
That's got to be changed.,0.0
And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.,0.0
Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities.,0.0
Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.,0.0
Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.,0.0
"A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.",0.0
"And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.",0.0
There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh - appropriation.,0.0
Now let me just tell you a little story.,0.0
"We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.",0.0
We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately.,0.0
That's the kind of defense program that uh - Mr. Carter wants.,0.0
Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.,0.0
You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.,0.0
I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.,0.0
"I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.",0.0
"I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.",0.0
"I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned.",0.0
"We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal.",1.0
It didn't happen.,1.0
We have a democracy in Portugal today.,1.0
"A few uh - months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East.",0.0
"Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.",0.0
"The facts are, there - the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh - at a low level.",0.0
The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point.,0.0
"The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East.",0.0
But let's turn for a minute to the uhh - southern African operations that are now going on.,0.0
The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa.,0.0
We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.,0.0
We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa.,0.0
We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority.,0.0
We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa.,0.0
"We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa.",0.0
The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa.,0.0
The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.,0.0
"And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes.",0.0
"And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?",0.0
I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.,0.0
Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO.,0.0
"I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.",0.0
I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy.,0.0
That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country.,1.0
"I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget.",0.0
"After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.",0.0
And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.,0.0
"Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.",1.0
"Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.",0.0
"We didn't go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time.",0.0
And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world.,0.0
"Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.",0.0
I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.,0.0
"But I have uh - an adequate background, I believe.",0.0
"I've served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan.",0.0
I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.,0.0
I've talked to them and I've listened.,0.0
"And I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations.",0.0
"What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.",0.0
"And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded.",0.0
I believe I know what this country ought to be.,0.0
"I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.",0.0
"Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.",0.0
"If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed.",1.0
"And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.",0.0
"This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy.",0.0
"Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret - in secret treaties that've been uh - pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it.",0.0
"So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.",0.0
"But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don't change - those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.",0.0
"First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford.",0.0
"In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.",1.0
"Recently Ian Smith, the uh - president of uh - Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal.",0.0
The American people don't know what those commitments are.,0.0
"We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.",0.0
These kinds of things have hurt us very much.,0.0
"I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.",0.0
And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.,0.0
When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense.,0.0
"Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.",0.0
But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.,0.0
"The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people.",1.0
This is a responsibility of the president.,0.0
And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.,1.0
Governor Carter again contradicts himself.,0.0
He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.,0.0
But let me talk just a minute about what we've done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration.,0.0
After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.,0.0
"But at the time that uh - I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement.",0.0
It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States.,0.0
"Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.",0.0
The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.,0.0
The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy.,0.0
I have made myself at least ten uh - speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.,0.0
I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.,0.0
"For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind.",0.0
"I would not ship that Arab country anything - no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing.",0.0
I wouldn't single out just food.,0.0
"Another thing that I'd like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world.",0.0
"When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.",0.0
"The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East.",0.0
Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.,0.0
"Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran.",0.0
"If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.",0.0
"This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.",0.0
We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.,0.0
And it's an overall sign of weakness.,0.0
"When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.",0.0
"It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.",0.0
But it was done three years ago and they're still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world.,0.0
"These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.",0.0
It's a matter of being tough.,0.0
It's a matter of being strong.,0.0
It's a matter of being consistent.,0.0
"Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s.",0.0
And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.,0.0
This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.,1.0
"If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.",0.0
And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.,0.0
I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.,0.0
"So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel.",0.0
I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.,0.0
He indicates he would not make those.,0.0
Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.,0.0
Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors.,0.0
"The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.",0.0
"It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.",0.0
"The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally.",0.0
"In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.",0.0
Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.,0.0
"I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.",0.0
It's for their security as well as ours.,0.0
"Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.",0.0
These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.,0.0
We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.,0.0
Our allies feel that we've neglected them.,0.0
The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there.,0.0
"Under this administration we've also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts.",0.0
"I would uh - also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain.",0.0
The worst inflation since the Great Depression.,0.0
"We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.",0.0
Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.,0.0
And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.,0.0
We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.,0.0
And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.,1.0
So strong economy is very important.,0.0
Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.,0.0
"And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.",0.0
And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.,0.0
"Under this administration we've had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other.",0.0
Our allies - the smaller countries get trampled in the rush.,0.0
"What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength.",0.0
We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.,0.0
"Now, I can't say when this can come.",0.0
But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.,0.0
"Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.",0.0
The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.,0.0
The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.,0.0
"So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both.",0.0
I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.,0.0
"But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.",0.0
"They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.",0.0
Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.,0.0
In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.,0.0
Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.,0.0
Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.,1.0
"As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.",0.0
In uh - November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh - the coming recession.,0.0
"In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations' heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand.",0.0
I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally.,0.0
Our relations with Japan have never been better.,0.0
I was the first United States president to visit Japan.,0.0
And we uh - had the emperor of Japan here this uh - past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship.,0.0
You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.,0.0
"Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.",0.0
First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977.,0.0
Uh - Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985.,0.0
Uh - that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program.,0.0
"Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a - an agreement that can be verified by both parties.",0.0
"In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire - their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft.",0.0
"In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.",0.0
Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.,0.0
"But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh - the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise.",0.0
"I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement.",0.0
"Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions.",0.0
"So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.",0.0
"I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh - can be uh - included within a SALT II agreement.",0.0
"He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.",0.0
"He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.",0.0
"We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.",1.0
"As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.",0.0
I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.,1.0
"Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement.",0.0
"I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.",0.0
I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.,0.0
Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.,0.0
We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.,0.0
"Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.",0.0
This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.,1.0
We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.,0.0
If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.,1.0
This has got to be stopped.,1.0
That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.,1.0
"No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.",0.0
I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.,0.0
I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.,0.0
"But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.",0.0
"Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.",1.0
And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.,1.0
We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.,1.0
This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.,0.0
And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.,0.0
"So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.",0.0
Potentially we're strong.,0.0
Under this administration that strength has not been realized.,0.0
"I must remind him that we're at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war.",0.0
Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.,0.0
"I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned - U. S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh - be constructed.",0.0
"But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.",0.0
The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.,0.0
The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.,0.0
"What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?",0.0
What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?,0.0
The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.,0.0
"What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?",0.0
Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.,0.0
I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.,0.0
And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.,0.0
"If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.",1.0
"If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.",1.0
"So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.",0.0
And I believe that we used our skill.,0.0
"Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations.",0.0
"He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.",0.0
"Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh - Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government.",0.0
"This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken.",0.0
"And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.",0.0
There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.,0.0
"But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement.",0.0
"And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible.",0.0
And we will do it with the highest moral principles.,0.0
"I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.",0.0
Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.,0.0
I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.,0.0
But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.,0.0
South Korea faces a very delicate situation.,0.0
"This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.",0.0
I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.,0.0
"This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.",0.0
This has not been an ancient history story.,0.0
"Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.",0.0
Another point I wanna make is this.,0.0
He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.,0.0
That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.,0.0
"While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.",0.0
We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems.,0.0
"Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.",0.0
Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war.,0.0
Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.,0.0
I don't agree with that statement.,0.0
I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.,0.0
He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.,0.0
And the last thing I wanna make is this.,0.0
He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.,0.0
We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office.,0.0
"But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.",0.0
The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.,0.0
"On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.",0.0
I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh - GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time.,0.0
But let me comment on the report.,0.0
"Somebody who sits in Washington, D. C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.",0.0
And let me make another observation.,0.0
"This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.",0.0
"He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez.",0.0
"And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.",0.0
Captain Miller is thankful.,0.0
The crew is thankful.,0.0
We did the right thing.,0.0
It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.,0.0
Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.,0.0
Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.,0.0
"But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.",0.0
And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.,1.0
"Well, I'm reluctant to uh comment on the recent report - I haven't read it.",0.0
I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.,0.0
He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.,0.0
I understand that the report today is accurate.,0.0
"Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report.",0.0
I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.,0.0
"I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.",0.0
"I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.",0.0
"The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred.",0.0
This is uh - what the American people want.,0.0
"When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.",0.0
"But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.",0.0
I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace.,1.0
This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.,0.0
I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.,0.0
It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.,0.0
It's a matter of morality.,0.0
"And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.",0.0
It may later be Catholics; it may be - later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country.,0.0
But we ought to stand staunch.,0.0
And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.,1.0
Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.,0.0
The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952.,0.0
"And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.",0.0
And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.,0.0
Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.,0.0
And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress - necessary legislation - my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh - participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott.,0.0
One other point.,0.0
"Because the Congress failed to act, I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh - participated in the Arab boycott.",0.0
"This is something that we can do; the Congress failed to do it, and we intend to do it.",0.0
Let me restate uh - our policy.,0.0
"As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.",0.0
"One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.",1.0
This is what the families of MIAs want.,0.0
"So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.",0.0
We've had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by - by private citizens.,0.0
"Several months ago the Vietnam government said, ""We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs.",0.0
"So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.",0.0
"I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.",0.0
But that's not enough.,0.0
"We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt, and Mr. Ford has just not done it.",0.0
"The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.",0.0
This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.,0.0
"Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?",1.0
"Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?",1.0
Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?,0.0
"Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?",0.0
Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world?,0.0
I believe we can and we ought to.,0.0
Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.,0.0
"In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.",0.0
Our people feel that we've lost something precious.,0.0
That's not necessary.,0.0
I wanna see our nation - return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again.,0.0
"I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps.",0.0
Why can't we have that once again?,0.0
"We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.",0.0
We haven't been lately.,0.0
We can be once again.,0.0
"We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.",0.0
It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.,0.0
"It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States.",0.0
"As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues.",0.0
"We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.",0.0
"In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving - long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership?",0.0
"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.",0.0
"Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces.",0.0
"I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.",0.0
The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.,0.0
I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.,0.0
"Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.",0.0
Not at all.,0.0
"overlapping, aren't those the real costs?",0.0
"No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.",0.0
But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.,0.0
I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh - give a tax reduction.,0.0
"With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.",0.0
These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.,0.0
Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.,0.0
Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.,0.0
If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.,0.0
The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.,0.0
"And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.",0.0
"I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.",0.0
"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country.""",0.0
"I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.",0.0
Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.,0.0
We can also have a- an end to the extremes.,0.0
"We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh - Medicaid uh - laws, and the uh - food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh - they don't have to pay any taxes on it.",0.0
"At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.",0.0
"So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who's still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working.",0.0
"But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.",0.0
I know I'm ready for it.,1.0
I think the American people are too.,1.0
I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.,1.0
"When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.",0.0
"Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh - Watergate and uh - the CIA revelations, people have feel - have felt that they've uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh - heat of the campaign - I've been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I've been campaigning for twenty-two months - I've made some mistakes.",0.0
And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.,0.0
I - I have to say that my campaign has been an open one.,0.0
And uh - the Playboy thing has been of great - very great concern to me.,0.0
I don't know how to deal with it exactly.,0.0
"Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.",0.0
"But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.",0.0
"If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.",0.0
"But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.",0.0
"I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.",0.0
"I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.",0.0
"I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.",0.0
"We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people.",0.0
They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.,0.0
"Yes, and I'm certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh - bad period of time in American political history.",0.0
"Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh - problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam.",0.0
"But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.",0.0
We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.,0.0
"Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.",0.0
"But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.",1.0
"I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised.",1.0
"And General Brown has indicated uh - his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, uh - in this situation, settle the matter.",0.0
"It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.",0.0
"Not this one, however, that you bring up.",0.0
General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance.,0.0
"He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.",0.0
"And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today.",0.0
"Now he did use uh - ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need as we enter into uh - negotiations uh - under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh - we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh - apologized, uh - would not have justified my asking for his resignation.",0.0
This one concerned uh - Great Britain.,0.0
I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire.,1.0
Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.,1.0
"This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.",0.0
I don't believe it does.,0.0
"At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.",0.0
Uh - very few people knew who I was.,0.0
"I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money.",0.0
"And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.",0.0
"And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.",0.0
"And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.",0.0
"Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.",0.0
"I'd say, several hundred of them.",0.0
"The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.",0.0
I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.,0.0
I chose Senator Walter Mondale.,0.0
"And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term.",0.0
"And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future.",0.0
Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make.,0.0
"I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?",0.0
I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.,0.0
"In the last five pres- vice presidential uh - nominees, uh - incumbents, three of them have become president.",0.0
But I think this is indicative of what I would do.,0.0
"The Governor may not have heard my uh - established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh - it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States.",0.0
"And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.",0.0
"I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown.",1.0
If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.,0.0
"I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.",0.0
Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.,1.0
So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.,0.0
"And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.",0.0
"Yes, I'd be glad to.",0.0
"This has not been done, unfortunately.",0.0
And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.,0.0
"Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.",0.0
We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.,0.0
"When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.",0.0
That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.,0.0
"And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously.",0.0
The last point is that the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work.,0.0
"We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.",1.0
"And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost.",0.0
One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare.,0.0
And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.,0.0
"And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments.",0.0
"Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.",0.0
Let me uh - speak out very strongly.,0.0
The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas.,0.0
"I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.",0.0
"We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period.",0.0
We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.,0.0
"The net result is uh - we think under Carla Hills, who's the chairman of my uh - urban development and uh - neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country.",0.0
"Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration.",0.0
"In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman.",0.0
"You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.",0.0
"In addition, uh - the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others.",0.0
"Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.",0.0
The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh - black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established.,0.0
"The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community.",0.0
"The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans.",0.0
"I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.",0.0
The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.,0.0
I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh - Voting Rights Acts and the uh - Civil Rights Acts in their uh - debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it.,0.0
This country uh - changed drastically in 1969 when the uh - terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and - and Gerald Ford became the presidents.,0.0
"There was a time when there was hope for those who uh - were poor and downtrodden and who were - uh elderly or who were - uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone.",0.0
"I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people - the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs.",1.0
It not only liberated - uh black people but it also liberated the whites.,0.0
"We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.",0.0
"Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.",0.0
And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.,0.0
"And there's been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language.",0.0
"And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.",0.0
But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.,0.0
It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.,0.0
And that's been lacking in the last eight years.,0.0
I would not work hard to support any of those.,0.0
I think abortion's wrong.,0.0
But I don't favor a constitutional amendment on the subject.,0.0
"I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.",0.0
"However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.",0.0
"But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.",0.0
"support the uh - Republican uh - platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh - outlaw abortions.",0.0
I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.,0.0
Uh I call that the people amendment.,0.0
I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh - we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice.,0.0
Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.,0.0
"Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools.",1.0
"Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.",0.0
"So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.",0.0
"I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe.",0.0
"And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.",0.0
"And in those two cases, I would favor them.",0.0
"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.",1.0
And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.,0.0
Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.,0.0
"Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.",0.0
But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?,0.0
"But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.",0.0
But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.,0.0
We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.,0.0
We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.",1.0
"Now in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation.",0.0
And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.,0.0
"The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.",0.0
It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.,0.0
"With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.",1.0
"Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.",0.0
Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.,0.0
One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.,0.0
There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.,0.0
Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.,0.0
Inflation is robbing us.,0.0
Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.,1.0
The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year.,1.0
And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.,0.0
And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it.,0.0
And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much.,1.0
He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.,0.0
"We'll never have a balanced budget, we'll never meet the needs of our people, we'll never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs.",0.0
"And we've probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because they've given up hope.",0.0
That is a very serious indictment of this administration.,1.0
It's probably the worst one of all.,1.0
"Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.",0.0
"When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention.",0.0
"At that time, uh - 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford.",0.0
"But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.",0.0
"And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread.",0.0
"I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.",0.0
"Uh - the polls uh - are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another.",0.0
"And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.",0.0
"I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.",0.0
My name wasn't even there.,0.0
And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent.,0.0
"So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.",0.0
I campaign among people.,0.0
I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.,1.0
I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.,1.0
"In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.",0.0
That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.,0.0
"And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense - just working people who believe in me - spread around the country uh - involved in the political campaign.",0.0
"So, the polls are interesting, but uh - I don't know how to explain the fluctuation.",0.0
"I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.",0.0
But I think our hold uh - of support among those who uh - are crucial to the election has been fairly steady.,0.0
"And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.",0.0
And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.,0.0
"I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.",1.0
He tends to distort on a number of occasions.,1.0
"Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.",0.0
He fails to point out that uh - in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam.,0.0
That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.,0.0
At the present time we're at peace.,0.0
We are not at war.,0.0

"But this administration doesn't believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military.",0.0
"So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.",0.0

"We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.",0.0
The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.,1.0

The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader.,0.0
I don't believe the present administration has done that.,0.0
We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.,0.0

Our education system can be improved.,0.0

"Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.",0.0
"Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.",0.0
The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.,0.0
But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.,0.0
"Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.",0.0
"I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.",0.0
"That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.",0.0
"Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.",0.0
"What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget.",0.0
I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.,0.0
"That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion.",0.0
"perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.",0.0
"I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.",0.0
"And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.",0.0
"And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.",0.0
You are robbing the American people of their savings.,1.0
"And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.",0.0
"Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.",0.0
"But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.",0.0
"I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.",0.0
"conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.",0.0
"We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.",0.0
...and $500 billion over the next five.,0.0
"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.",0.0
those imports have been reduced.,0.0
"And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.",0.0
"In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.",0.0
Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.,0.0
"put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.",0.0
"Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.",0.0
their Social Security tax payments by 50%.,0.0
"That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.",0.0
"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.",0.0
"It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.",0.0
"And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers.",0.0
Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?,0.0
Why not leave it with them?,0.0
"Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.",0.0
"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself.",0.0
"Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.",0.0
"But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.",0.0
"To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.",0.0
"The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.",0.0
But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.,0.0
"And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.",0.0
"There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.",0.0
"We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.",0.0
"I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.",0.0
"the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible.",0.0
All of these things can be done.,0.0
When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%.,0.0
"That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.",0.0
"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.",1.0
"all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.",0.0
"I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.",0.0
"and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.",0.0
"I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.",1.0
"But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.",0.0
We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.,0.0
"We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.",0.0
"We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.",0.0
"I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.",0.0
"Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.",0.0
"According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.",0.0
"So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.",0.0
"Well, as I've said, I am not an enemy of conservation.",0.0
I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.,0.0
"But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left.",0.0
"That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.",0.0
"As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.",0.0
"Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.",0.0
And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo.,0.0
"So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.",0.0
"But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.",0.0
"Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.",0.0
"And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem.",0.0
"The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million.",0.0
And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity.,0.0
"It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.",0.0
"I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.",0.0
"Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.",0.0
"When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.",0.0
"And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.",0.0
"Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.",0.0
public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.,0.0
"I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.",0.0
"But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.",0.0
"And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.",0.0
"And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.",1.0
And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.,1.0
"So, yes, I told the American Legion National!",0.0
"Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses.",0.0
That only makes sense.,0.0
"But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.",1.0
"Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.",0.0
"I. too, believe in the voluntary military.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.",0.0
"I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.",0.0
Recognize that we have a voluntary military.,0.0
"We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment.",0.0
"And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home.",0.0
As an aid to enlistment.,0.0
"Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education.",0.0
"In 1977, we took that away from the military.",0.0
That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.,0.0
"So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.",1.0
"Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.",0.0
"We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.",0.0
"Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.",0.0
"The other day, I just - I'll hasten - I just saw one example.",0.0
Down in Texas.,0.0
I saw a high school that is military.,0.0
I'll catch up with it later.,0.0
"I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.",0.0
"or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.",0.0
"That is just a downpayment, in my opinion.",0.0
"But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.",0.0
I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.,0.0
"The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.",0.0
I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.,1.0
"Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.",0.0
But that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about.,0.0
He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.,0.0
"We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.",0.0
But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.,0.0
"And therefore, if I only had another second left, I'd say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.",0.0
I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.,0.0
I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.,0.0
The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell!,0.0
"If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money.",0.0
"What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?",0.0
I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.,0.0
"But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?",0.0
New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit.,0.0
"But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.",0.0
Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?,0.0
"But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.",0.0
"I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.",0.0
"The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.",0.0
And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?,0.0
Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.,0.0
The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.,0.0
We could have an urban homestead act.,0.0
"What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.",0.0
"All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .",0.0
"Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.",0.0
"It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.",1.0
"Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.",0.0
"I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.",0.0
"We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains.",0.0
"I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.",0.0
"And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.",0.0
"We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from.",0.0
"It's going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco.",0.0
"That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.",0.0
"In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.",0.0
John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.,0.0
It will come from the pockets of the people.,1.0
It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.,1.0
"And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities.",0.0
"if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.",0.0
"Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.",0.0
But the Federal Government doesn't make money.,0.0
It just takes - from the people.,0.0
"And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.",0.0
"Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II.",0.0
"I stood there, and I met the people.",0.0
And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.,0.0
"And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out.",0.0
"But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.",0.0
"Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?",0.0
It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.,0.0
"We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.",0.0
And why is that?,0.0
It's because they have lost their industry.,0.0
And why have they lost their industry?,0.0
"It's because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there.",0.0
"I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.",0.0
"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.",0.0
"When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.",0.0
"Well, we've seen what has happened.",0.0
We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.,0.0
"Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.",0.0
"And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.",0.0
Let me say this.,0.0
I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.,0.0
I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.,0.0
"I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.",0.0
"And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more.",0.0
"So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.",0.0
"And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income.",0.0
"I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about.",0.0
"But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.",0.0
"Miss Quinn, I don't have to.",0.0
I've done it.,0.0
"We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.",0.0
"And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.",0.0
"And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.",0.0
"Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years.",0.0
"And John tells us that first, we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes.",0.0
"Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.",0.0
Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.,0.0
But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs.,0.0
Government always needs the money it gets.,0.0
"And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.",0.0
"Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.",0.0
And that state we controlled spending.,0.0
We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.,0.0
"But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.",0.0
I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.,0.0
"And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.",0.0
"And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.",0.0
We have considered inflation in our figures.,0.0
"We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.",0.0
"I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.",0.0
We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.,1.0
"Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.",0.0
This is 1980 and not 1966.,0.0
"But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.",0.0
"Spending, in other words.",0.0
"But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.",0.0
"It doesn't accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor.",0.0
"In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.",0.0
And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.,0.0
"Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.",0.0
And John has just made up some very interesting figures.,0.0
"But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.",0.0
"Now also, with regard to the figures about California.",0.0
"The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.",0.0
It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.,0.0
"And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.",0.0
"And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.",0.0
"And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.",1.0
"Oh, I'm it's my question.",0.0
"But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.",1.0
"Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.",0.0
For a belief that law must be based on a higher law.,0.0
For a return to traditions and values that we once had.,0.0
"Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.",0.0
"Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child.",0.0
"I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.",0.0
"Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that.",0.0
"But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.",0.0
That's what elections are all about.,0.0
"Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues.",0.0
"But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state.",1.0
"Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion.",0.0
I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.,0.0
"And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.",0.0
"And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, ""view,"" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government.",0.0
I believe in freedom of choice.,0.0
I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.,0.0
I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.,0.0
"On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.",0.0
"And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.",0.0
"But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.",0.0
"And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.",0.0
"I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, ""Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work.""",0.0
"But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.",0.0
"The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life.",0.0
"Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.",0.0
I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.,0.0
"With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all.",1.0
That's the one who is being aborted.,1.0
And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.,0.0
"I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?",1.0
I happen to believe it is.,0.0
I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.,0.0
"And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.",0.0
"And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.",1.0
"Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.",0.0
And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.,0.0
But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate.,0.0
And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.,0.0
"Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.",0.0
"That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible.",0.0
We spoke a multitude of tongues.,1.0
"If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.",1.0
"And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.",1.0
"Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.",0.0
we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.,0.0
"And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.",0.0
That the best is over.,0.0
That we must cut back.,0.0
That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity.,0.0
"That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.",0.0
"Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars.",0.0
We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees.,0.0
But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.,0.0
"The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth.",1.0
"For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday.",0.0
I still believe that.,0.0
I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight.,0.0
"I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again.",0.0
"We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.",0.0
I think we ought to get at it.,0.0
"Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.",0.0
I think you've seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing - we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft.,0.0
"We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.",0.0
"I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me.",0.0
I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.,0.0
I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.,0.0
"If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy?",0.0
Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?,0.0
Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?,0.0
Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote?,0.0
I don't think you do think that.,0.0
"And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980.",0.0
"You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing.",0.0
"It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.",0.0
We've got to stop drifting.,0.0
What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.,0.0
"A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November.",0.0
Next Tuesday is Election Day.,0.0
"I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.",0.0
I do know what he has said about mine.,0.0
"And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.",1.0
"Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.",0.0
"Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.",0.0
And to maintain that peace requires strength.,0.0
America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.,0.0
"We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carter's, until we're faced each time with a crisis.",0.0
And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.,0.0
I have seen four wars in my lifetime.,1.0
I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.,1.0
"I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.",1.0
Yes.,0.0
And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.,0.0
I'm only reducing the amount of the increase.,0.0
"In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending.",0.0
"Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office.",0.0
"And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.",0.0
I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.,0.0
I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.,0.0
H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.,0.0
It would be neat and plausible and wrong.,0.0
"The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.",0.0
"Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.",0.0
"Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense.",0.0
But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.,0.0
"We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.",0.0
"In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.",0.0
"This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.",0.0
I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.,0.0
"There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.",0.0
"That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves.",0.0
That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.,0.0
"Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country.",0.0
"In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.",0.0
Now we have two major carrier task forces.,0.0
We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region.,0.0
"And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.",0.0
"But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.",0.0
"This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world.",0.0
"Well yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous Administrations in the preceding eight years to this Administration.",0.0
"I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.",0.0
"I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.",0.0
"Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.",0.0
"Well, there are various elements of defense.",0.0
"One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign.",0.0
Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.,0.0
"I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors - both Democrats and Republicans - have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.",0.0
"In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.",0.0
"But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.",0.0
"Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.",0.0
Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.,0.0
"In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.",0.0
We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.,0.0
"In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War.",1.0
The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.,0.0
"In addition, we've brought down inflation.",0.0
"Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.",0.0
It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.,0.0
"In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.",0.0
"The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.",1.0
I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal.,1.0
"which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.",1.0
"And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation.",1.0
"So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.",0.0
"So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.",0.0
"We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well.",0.0
"As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.",0.0
We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.,0.0
"At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.",0.0
"Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.",0.0
"The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.",0.0
"And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.",0.0
"This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.",0.0
"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.",1.0
It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.,0.0
It is now running at 12.7%.,0.0
President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created.,0.0
"Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs.",0.0
"But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.",0.0
Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.,1.0
"And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.",1.0
"Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.",1.0
We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.,0.0
We have inflation because the Government is living too well.,0.0
"And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending.",0.0
I see my time is running out here.,0.0
I'll have to get this out very fast.,0.0
"Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.",0.0
And my economic plan calls for that.,0.0
The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.,1.0
But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.,1.0
"most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.",0.0
I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.,1.0
"As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.",1.0
"Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.",1.0
"We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.",0.0
I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.,0.0
And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.,0.0
"Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.",1.0
He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.,1.0
I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week.,0.0
"One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.",0.0
"This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.",1.0
In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.,0.0
"Thank you, sir.",0.0
"The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.",1.0
The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.,0.0
"And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?",0.0
"I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones.",1.0
"Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area.",0.0
"And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.",0.0
"The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't getting any tax from that now.",0.0
I think there are things to do in this regard.,0.0
I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.,0.0
You have to see it to believe it.,0.0
"It looks like a bombed-out city - great, gaunt skeletons of buildings.",1.0
"Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair.""",1.0
And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.,0.0
"There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat.",0.0
"And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation.",0.0
"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?",1.0
"Nothing has been done.""",1.0
I believe in it.,0.0
"I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.",1.0
"I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when there's hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth.",0.0
"But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.",1.0
It's a bully pulpit.,1.0
And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.,0.0
"When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.",0.0
"We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials.",0.0
This has been a very successful effort.,0.0
That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed.,0.0
"Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.",0.0
"We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.",0.0
"Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.",0.0
We also are pursuing housing programs.,0.0
We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.,0.0
"These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.",0.0
It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.,0.0
"I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.",0.0
I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country.,0.0
Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.,0.0
"We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.",0.0
"Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants.",0.0
"Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still holding themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our nation its strength.",0.0
"In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government.",0.0
"Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.",0.0
"I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.",0.0
"The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.",0.0
"But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.",1.0
They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.,0.0
"Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage.",0.0
"I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get.",1.0
"And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.",0.0
"With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.",0.0
It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.,0.0
"We have made good progress, and there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic party since ancient history in this country's political life are a very important element of the future.",0.0
"In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life.",1.0
"This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.",1.0
"There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.",0.0
"Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.",0.0
"At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism.",0.0
Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment.,0.0
"There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.",0.0
"Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons.",0.0
Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons.,0.0
"In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.",0.0
"When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business.",1.0
"And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it.",0.0
"This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.",1.0
We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.,0.0
"We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran, that might be of a warlike nature.",0.0
"When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.",0.0
"That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.",0.0
"Barbara, you've asked that question twice.",0.0
I think you ought to have at least one answer to it.,0.0
"And I said, well, yes.",0.0
"And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?",0.0
"These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.",0.0
"I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?",0.0
"What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?",0.0
And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.,0.0
"In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll carne home.",0.0
"The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.",0.0
And we've been guilty of that.,0.0
"Because someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people.",0.0
"I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we're maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all - the Soviet Union.",1.0
"Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that.",0.0
"And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.",0.0
I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.,0.0
"What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights - commercial air flights - to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers.",0.0
"Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.",0.0
"Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities.",0.0
"And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.",0.0
"These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.",0.0
"I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind.",1.0
"And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.",0.0
"I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.",0.0
"I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy.",0.0
"And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time.",0.0
The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.,0.0
"Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have.",0.0
It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.,0.0
"Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.",0.0
And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.,0.0
"Yes, I'd be glad to.",0.0
Inflation.,0.0
"unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.",0.0
Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons.,0.0
"To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.",1.0
"He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.",0.0
The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.,0.0
"There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.",0.0
"It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement.",1.0
"You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.",0.0
"But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.",1.0
Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.,1.0
"He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.",0.0
"If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.",0.0
This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.,0.0
It would be very disturbing to American people.,1.0
"In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.",0.0
"My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States.",0.0
"It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.",0.0
"And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.",0.0
"It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable.",0.0
And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.,0.0
"I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about.",0.0
"I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was.",1.0
She said she thought nuclear weaponry - and the control of nuclear arms.,1.0
This is a formidable force.,1.0
Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.,0.0
"If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.",0.0
That's one major war explosion in a warhead.,0.0
"We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.",0.0
"The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.",0.0
"I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.",0.0
What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.,0.0
"It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy.",0.0
We've been very successful in both cases.,0.0
We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third.,0.0
We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.,0.0
"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.",1.0
We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history.,0.0
We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.,0.0
"And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.",0.0
"This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.",0.0
"I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.",0.0
"The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.",0.0
The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.,0.0
Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.,0.0
"With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.",0.0
"I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.",0.0
"The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.",0.0
"Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.",0.0
"It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.",0.0
This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.,0.0
Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.,0.0
And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.,0.0
We have the sources here.,0.0
"We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.",0.0
"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.",1.0
"Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.",0.0
We cannot cast aside these regulations.,0.0
"We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.",0.0
"Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.",0.0
He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.,1.0
"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.",0.0
I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.,0.0
"It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy.",0.0
"And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.",0.0
And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.,0.0
"And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.",0.0
"So, I think some of those charges are missing the point.",0.0
"And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.",0.0
Sure.,0.0
"As a matter of fact,.",0.0
"the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.",0.0
"Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen.",0.0
The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often.,0.0
"As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist.",0.0
"We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.",0.0
"So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.",0.0
"If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.",0.0
"It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency.",1.0
"We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country.",0.0
"As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.",0.0
"The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.",0.0
"There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.",0.0
"The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase.",0.0
"It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then.",0.0
"Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.",0.0
"We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.",0.0
"They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.",0.0
"But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.",0.0
"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.",0.0
"Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.",1.0
"I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.",0.0
"These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.",1.0
"But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.",0.0
"And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.",0.0
That is the way it will stay.,0.0
"Well, that just isn't true.",0.0
"It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.",0.0
"Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.",0.0
"Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother.",1.0
"And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary.",0.0
That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.,0.0
"I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money.",0.0
There are some changes that I would like to make.,0.0
I'd like to change that.,0.0
"It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people.",0.0
"We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact.",0.0
"In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.",0.0
"Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.",0.0
"Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.",0.0
"These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.",0.0
"Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.",0.0
"When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress.",0.0
I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.,0.0
I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them.,0.0
I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.,0.0
There is something else about Social Security.,0.0
"I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.",1.0
"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.",0.0
"The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.",1.0
These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.,0.0
I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address.,0.0
"I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.",0.0
"So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.",0.0
Thank you.,0.0
"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.",0.0
"First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described.",0.0
"This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.",1.0
"The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.",1.0
"The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America.",0.0
"This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.",0.0
"Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.",1.0
"Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.",0.0
I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.,0.0
"Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.",1.0
"He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford.",1.0
"Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.",1.0
"But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.",0.0
I said many foolish things back in those days.,0.0
"But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.",0.0
"And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.",0.0
"That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.",0.0
It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.,0.0
I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party.,0.0
I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.,0.0
"For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.",0.0
Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.,0.0
Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.,0.0
"When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.",0.0
And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.,0.0
"That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.",0.0
"Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges.",0.0
"While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.",0.0
"I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.",0.0
"If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.",0.0
"I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.",0.0
"Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.",0.0
One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country.,0.0
"We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.",0.0
"In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected - not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living - because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country.",1.0
We have made remarkable success.,1.0
It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.,0.0
"So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.",0.0
"Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.",0.0
And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.,0.0
"But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.",1.0
And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.,0.0
I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.,0.0
"First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.",0.0
I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.,0.0
"Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.",0.0
I've been President now for almost four years.,0.0
"I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.",0.0
And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.,0.0
"As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.",0.0
I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.,0.0
I consider myself in the mainstream of my party.,0.0
I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.,0.0
The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.,1.0
We must have a society that's just and fair.,1.0
"And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.",1.0
"I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world.",0.0
"In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.",0.0
"I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts.",0.0
"But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50.",0.0
"And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.",0.0
"It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.",1.0
"The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision.",1.0
Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.,1.0
And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.,0.0
"If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation.",0.0
"And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.",0.0
There is a partnership involved in our nation.,0.0
"To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future.",0.0
I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.,0.0
"Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible.",0.0
"I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.",0.0
"But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.",0.0
"Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.",0.0
"I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?",0.0
Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?,0.0
Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?,0.0
Is America as respected throughout the world as itwas?,0.0
"Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?",0.0
"And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.",0.0
"If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.",0.0
This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.,0.0
"We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.",0.0
We talk about the unemployment lines.,0.0
"If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California.",0.0
All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.,0.0
"I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.",0.0
I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.,0.0
I know because we did it there.,0.0
We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.,0.0
"We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.",0.0
"We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.",0.0
And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.,0.0
"I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.",1.0
"And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.",1.0
